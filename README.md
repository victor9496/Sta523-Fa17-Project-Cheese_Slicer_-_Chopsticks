# Project-Cheese_Slicer_-_Chopsticks


1. Motivation
- We wanted to apply bayesian statistical methods that we have learned so far in 601 and 523, such as JAGS. We had theoretical understanding of the hierarchical models but never had a chance to apply those models in real data. 
2. Objective
- Graduate students in Duke needs to find their own apartments off campus. During the process of looking for an apartment, information asymmetry  between potential tenants and apartments exists. We hope that the shiny app facilitates studentsâ€™ decision making. 
- Provide dynamic ranking based on our tolerance of uncertainty and constraints including price, distance.
