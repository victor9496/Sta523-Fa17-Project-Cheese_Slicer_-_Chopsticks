Before I signed the lease I repeatedly asked about the total expense of utilities and was told it would be between $150-160/month. I never use my dishwasher or put my air conditioning below 76 and just got my first utility bill which is well over $250. Management told me I could pay them for the spectrum wifi and cable (which we are forced to pay either to them or First Billing for $100/ month even though Spectrum offers more extensive services for $29.99) and then First Billing still billed me because West Village never received their payment. West village never informed me of overpaying, and so was obviously planning on pocketing the money. The management claims the apartments are gated but every other week the fobs to my apartment aren't working and they just put up a sign and leave the doors propped open. They don't answer their emails 9/10 times and refuse to do simple repairs to very old apartments. I should have researched more before signing a lease. Oh also, there's a clause in the lease that says the lease can't be changed, even under extreme circumstances like personal or family illness. All other apartments I've ever heard of allow you to pay a penalty and leave if something extreme comes up like a severe illness when the tenet is unable to pay due to medical fees. When I've asked to speak to corporate contact, management at West Village refused, telling me there was no such thing, even though all I had to do was google it to find the Connor Group contact information. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> The management of West Village is completely unethical.

After conversation with most of them, it has come to light that their base offer at the end of your lease is to increase your rent by $250. If you say you're going to move out, they immediately contact you back with a $50 offer. This has happened with at least 4 people that I've talked to. If you plan on living here expect at least a $50 rent increase per year. The lady at the office tried to justify this by saying that it was less than moving cost so it was a better option than moving. They are basically banking on the fact that you won't move to raise rent by a $600/year. The cable bill has gone up from $65-$90 with no change in plan. The trash bill has gone up from $20-$45 with a reduction in service (used to pickup 5 days a week, now pick up 3 days a week). I've also heard mixed comments from residents about whether or not they are forced to pay for parking. I wasn't but a few of my neighbors have. The gym is packed most of the day so good luck getting a workout in the morning or evening hours. If you're not in a parking spot by 8pm, good luck finding parking. On op of that, my hallway smells like cigarettes (6th floor) and nothing has been done about it. Overall, this place is overrated and over priced. Only thing that got me here was the central location but with other options popping up around Durham, I'd avoid this place. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I've lived here for a couple years now and have made quite a few friends in the building. After conversation with most of them, it has come to light that their base offer at the end of your lease is to increase your rent by $250. If you say you're going to move out, they immediately contact you back with a $50 offer. This has happened with at least 4 people that I've talked to. If you plan on living here expect at least a $50 rent increase per year. The lady at the office tried to justify this by saying that it was less than moving cost so it was a better option than moving. They are basically banking on the fact that you won't move to raise rent by a $600/year. The cable bill has gone up from $65-$90 with no change in plan.

The leasing staff is completely incompetent and apathetic. It took west village more than 2 months to send me my security deposit when North Carolina general statutes clearly dictate that security deposits must be refunded within 30 days of lease termination. At one point after the leasing staff neglected to record my forwarding address for the third time, I was told &amp;quot;You set up mail forwarding right? Well, you should see it eventually.&amp;quot; WOW!

What good is a nice apt if you cant enjoy it The Conner Group: I am writing this letter in regards to the issues that I have experienced since I moved into West Village Apartments on July 10,2017. Upon signing my lease I made it clear that I opposed the mandatory Cable/Internet fee of $100. Citing &quot;Trying to promote pay-TV competition and keep prices in check, the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to wipe out deals giving cable operators exclusive access to apartments, condos and other centrally managed real estate developments.&quot;-FCC. Alexis the leasing agent who handled my move in had knowledge of my discontent and I ask to speak with the property Manager at move in she assured me I would get a call which I did not. I refuse to sign the form that stated that I agreed with this service. Last Thursday August 31,2017 I was able to speak with Stephany one of the Managers I expressed my discontent about the cable to her, she looked into my file and verified that had sign the addendum but the agreement of the exclusive cable company. I was told that she would get back to me after talking to her Manager which I have yet to get a response. As a consumer I am entitled to spend my money the way I chooses and not be forced to use a service that I don't want. The second issue that concerns me is that I was promised stainless steal appliances when I came in April to see the apt. Upon move in no stainless steal appliances, I was told they were on backorder which annoyed me because I was promised back in April I didn't move in till July, West Village labels itself as a luxury apartments; stainless steel appliances are basic amenities in luxury apt. Around Aug 20, 2017 I was very happy to see my appliances delivered, however as of this writing most of the appliances are sitting in my living room still in boxes. This is unacceptable as the holiday just past and I could not enjoy the luxury of entertaining my in LUXURY apt. Also its advertised as a gated community however our gate stay open over night, as a parent this concerns me I not paying to live in a open gated community. West Village makes a lot of claims which they have been failing to live up too, the hallways are cluttered with boxes that tenants have set out and have stayed there for a whole month instead of telling the tenant that the trash collector doesn't accept cardboard boxes and that they are responsible for disposing of their cardboard it sits there and makes the hallway look very bad. I have been very unhappy living here and it's only been 2 months I want to be able to enjoy where I live unfortunately I haven't I hope this problems will be resolved ASAP.

Let me share with you my complaints with being displaced for 4+ weeks while the apartment complex &amp;quot;looks after your renovations&amp;quot; and actually NO ONE was looking after restorations. 100+ year old pine wood floors. ALMOST. and I mean almost. RUINED. because it took 5+days to get a restoration crew there. After a contracted maintenance crew knocked off a sprinkler head, while neglecting to turn off the water, subsequently locked themselves out, and then had to kick in my front door. My front door was unsecured for 3+ days. I'm still waiting on repairs as communication between corporate/local/insurance has been LESS than ideal. I still don't have a functional front door - not to mention my dog and daughter (6) and the glass mirrored door that was shattered and still continues to shed glass - I don't want either my dog or my daughter to walk into broken glass. I was still expected to pay rent in the 5+ weeks that I was displaced. Even when I was told to move out of the hotel I am still waiting for the insurance checks to replace the furniture that was destroyed - seriously, the only thing I had to sit in was my office chair. But &amp;quot;hey were &amp;quot;providing me with a place to stay&amp;quot;. and I understand that in North Carolina this is common practice. it just sucks. I'm a single mom, I saved and overlapped moving by a month - LITERALLY on the last trip to pick up things from my old house was when I received the phone call informing me there had been &amp;quot;an incident&amp;quot; in my apartment.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="112104581"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="112100160" data-beginyear="2017" data-endyear="2017" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20170829"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2017 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 08/29/2017</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> The staff at West Village Apartments is great!

We should have been more wary when the leasing agent rushed us into signing a lease. The management is absolutely horrible, both in timeliness and professionalism.

If you have a problem in your apartment and call the office someone will say it will be taken care of, and then nothing will happen. You will then call back, requiring you to talk to MULTIPLE agents who each will tell you they will pass along the message (which doesn't happen). I was not aware prior to coming here that the management had changed to Connor group in January, 2017 resulting in upwards of $500 rent increases as well as just complete incompetency. There are several new apartment complexes in the surrounding area with MUCH better managing companies (Liberty warehouse, etc), and I would highly recommend looking into those. While the location is great, they have been getting away with bad customer service because of it, but now that there is significant competition nearby I would really think about the decision to live with West Village. My experience is also not solitary, as there are many residents who had similar situations, do your research and talk to current residents before signing this place! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Don't do it!

My wife and I are currently dealing with an issue that could have been resolved if taken seriously when we first reported it 8 months ago. Now we've had to leave our apartment so our kitchen and bathrooms can be treated creating a huge inconvenience for us and our pets. And if we do ever receive any communication responding to our maintenance requests or communications to the main office it's never clear who we are talking to and every conversation is like starting from scratch. The only time the office takes an email or maintenance request seriously is when you copy the Connor Group and express your displeasure at the multiple previous emails that have not been responded to. Living in Downtown Durham is amazing but living at West Village is AWFUL and nobody should move in to this complex. We sincerely regret our decision to do so, will not renew our lease and encourage everyone considering moving here to look elsewhere. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We were made the promise of new appliances that have yet to materialize.

I highly recommend the West Village for families, grad students and professionals! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3628664" data-review-id="111984126"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111984126"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111980942" data-beginyear="2016" data-endyear="2017" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20170316"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2016 - 2017 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/16/2017</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I've been here just under a year now and really enjoy my apartment. You can't beat WV's location anywhere else in downtown. The units are really cool with exposed brick in the older buildings, but sometimes you can hear your neighbors through the floors/walls. Shay has been amazing with everything so far with my experiences at the office. Unfortunately rent prices are a bit inflated, so it will be interesting to see what the leasing office does to combat the competitive pricing at other apartment communities in the area.

Reagan Vaughan was my leasing agent, and I applaud her for such a warm and welcoming experience. Reagan has such a pleasant personality, a warm smile, kind greeting and she was always willing to help and advise me on selecting the apartment that directly catered to what I was looking for. I appreciated her professionalism and knowledge in this area. Although West Village offers many different apartment layouts I love the one I chose. The appliances are all stainless steel, modern decor and sleek style, especially the brick walls and high ceilings. This is definitely Loft style living. Understandably with that at times noise will carry between apartments and I would simply say talk to your neighbor if it ever really gets that bad. The front office is also always willing to help but I believe this is the nature of just living in ANY apartment you can't account for the behaviors of people who are just not willing to live civilly or respect their neighbors. I've called for maintenance only once in my unit and maintenance fixed the minor problem immediately and I have not to call back again. The area is Fabulous you are close to dining, entertainment - The DPAC, Carolina Theater and in walking distance to almost everything. This is the heart of downtown living. The Villages provides many amenities such as a Gym, concierge package delivery, pools and barbecue grills. I live in the COBB building and I also have across the street access to the parking garage - YES! that makes it so easy when I do my local grocery shopping. You also have some Duke offices in the main lobby and you are very close to Duke East campus and the great Ninth street area. I am looking forward to the summer of 2017 to spread my wings and take in all the sites and local city events of Durham. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I moved into West Village apartments in November 2016.

I can walk anywhere I need to go... work, church, the DBAP ball park, the DPAC theater, parks, shops, and restaurants/cafes/breweries galore. One of my favorite things to do is walk to the Saturday farmer's market and weekend food truck rodeos. I especially love watching the sun rise over downtown every morning as the city begins to wake up. I thought having a dog in the city was going to be difficult but I've found that we're actually more active with the easy access to Duke's east campus and other walking trails. I also really appreciate that our parking is secure - that's hard to find downtown. I'll also add that I'm a professional in my 30's and have found this to be a quiet and enjoyable place to live. In my experience, the West Village staff has been very helpful. This is a huge property and, still, they know who I am and greet me by name. They've been very attentive and prompt replying to the few maintance or building-related requests I've made. In particular, Shay is absolutely wonderful, and I really appreciate Brittney's dedication and friendliness. I could go on, but the bottom line is that you can't beat the location and low-maintainance living. Yes, you pay for it, but their prices are fairly comparable to the rest of the market downtown and on 9th Street. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I've been a resident in the Moore Building (Phase3) at West Village for several months and have really enjoyed my experience living downtown.

They've been very attentive and prompt replying to the few maintance or building-related requests I've made. In particular, Shay is absolutely wonderful, and I really appreciate Brittney's dedication and friendliness. I could go on, but the bottom line is that you can't beat the location and low-maintainance living. Yes, you pay for it, but their prices are fairly comparable to the rest of the market downtown and on 9th Street. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"><a class="photoGallery" href="#"><img class="resident-image gtmEventData_0" alt="(Resident photo)" data-review-photo="true" data-image-id="8783661229048185787121.jpg" src="//cimg9.ibsrv.net/ibimg/www.apartmentratings.com/90x60_60-1-fffbg/8783661229048185787121.jpg" /></a></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3598628" data-review-id="111935642"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111935642"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111935156" data-beginyear="2016" data-endyear="2017" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20170112"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2016 - 2017 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 01/12/2017</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I've been living at West Village for over two months now, and have enjoyed it very much.

This can lead to a noisy environment but it's entirely up to how your neighbors are. The Phase 1 and 2 apartments have an open concept design, so bedroom walls do not go all the way to the ceiling. So I would not recommend these apartments if you have roommates as you'll be able to hear everything. But a one bedroom unit would be fine. The price point is higher than some in the area, but I suppose that's justified by the location. overall it's a fine apartment if you can afford it.

Would definitely recommend. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3592194" data-review-id="111925227"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111925227"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111919778" data-beginyear="2015" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="1" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20161215"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2015 - 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 12/15/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> There is some expectation of experiencing issues related to a renovated warehouse.

This place is a dream and I hope to stay here and be a part of this fabric for years to come. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3580328" data-review-id="111905586"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111905586"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111896120" data-beginyear="2016" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20161106"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 11/06/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Great place to live.

The location is prime in downtown Durham, NC. The staff is attentive, friendly, and well qualified. The renovated tobacco factory lofts are beautiful and &quot;historical chic&quot; with exposed piping, wood beams and floors, and granite countertops. The large windows allow for ample natural light and lovely views of the adjacent brick facades and urban landscape. Kia, Shay, and Alexis form an amazing sales/management team and they will greet you, and all your requests, with the utmost professionalism and timely response. Pedro and his maintenance crew are quick to service all repairs. Residency also includes access to two pools, a well-equiped gym, and courtyards with gas grills. Trash collection, cable/wifi, and utilities are not included in the rent but the rates are standard and metered. NC and Durham have no rent control policies so your lease is annually reassessed for market value. In our search for rental housing in the triangle, we viewed numerous properties but West Village stood out from all the rest and continues to exceed our expectations. We would highly recommend this apartment community. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We have lived in the West Village for 8 months now and we couldn't be more pleased with the entire package.

Thus far I'm very happy with the West Village Apartments. The rent is probably the most expensive of the Durham area luxury apartments, and definitely from a space perspective you can get more space for less money. However, the location of the West village simply can't be beat, and in my opinion thats the reason why the price is justified. 1 mile from Whole Foods for groceries, 2 blocks from the farmers market, walking distance to DPAC, downtown Durham, and the Tobacco campus. If you have to travel its about a 20 minute drive to RDU, which is pretty close. Duke Hospital is around 5 minutes away. For me personally, my work is a 10 minute commute. To a large extend you are paying for the convenience. The amenities of the apartments are also quite nice. The gym is probably the largest I've seen of all the luxury apartments, and they have a great pool thats easy to get to. High powered grills were recently added making BBQ'ing fairly easy. In the Moore building also has a parking garage under the building and its never full, so parking is great especially if its raining and you have groceries to carry. My only negative is that in the 8 months I've been at West Village the fire alarm has gone off in the middle of the night 3 times for non-fire related things. I think this is fixed but it was a bit annoying. Additionally, it can be noisy from the train that passes by at night. That being said I basically don't hear my neighbors at all. Plus I can make a ton of noise and I haven't heard any complaints from the neighbors, so sound between units is quite good. There is a feeling that because the rent is so high, there should be zero problems can occasionally stuff happens. But thats life and in the grand scheme of things, I haven't observed too many issues. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I moved into the West Village Apartments back in January of 2016, and have been living here for about 8 whole months in the Moore building.

But thats life and in the grand scheme of things, I haven't observed too many issues. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3547166" data-review-id="111857932"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111857932"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111855285" data-beginyear="2015" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20160828"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2015 - 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 08/28/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Great location, beautiful apartments!

The exposed brick, 18ft ceilings, and open floor plan make for a very cool space. New management recently took over. The staff has been great - very friendly and helpful.

She is absolutely awesome. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3521143" data-review-id="111820498"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111820498"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111810256" data-beginyear="2015" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20160613"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2015 - 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/13/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Pros: Location is amazing!

I have no complains about the noise from my neighbors and have found everyone to be friendly. The gym is impressive for an apartment complex and the new pool is a great place to grill or hang out with friends. I have found the new management to be accommodating to my requests and eager to make a positive change for the community. Cons: It is a bit pricier than several of the complexes downtown but management has promised continued renovations and amenities to account for the price. Also, I think management could host more community events to promote meeting our neighbors.

I really liked it here for the last two years, but it is time to go. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3506490" data-review-id="111798990"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111798990"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111778032" data-beginyear="2015" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20160419"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2015 - 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/19/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> DO NOT MOVE HERE!!

Keep that secluded to your offices, not for residents/prospects to hear. Rent is being raised 460 dollars at the end of my lease term. If that's what you get for living as a refugee in another building for 6 weeks of the summer because your AC is broke, and the paper thin walls block no sound from the neighbors drunken college parties that mgmt brushes off and laughs about, then this is the perfect place for you. Not to mention the swarms of termites that have consumed my neighbors apartment that simply deemed a subtle apology and they were &quot;allowed&quot; the opportunity for a lease break. If you want to sleep before 3 am and 4 am on the weekends, choose somewhere else to live.

Overall we have been happy here. Our apartment has a lot of character with high ceilings, exposed brick, rustic wood floors and some old features from when this was a factory or warehouse. Also, we have a huge outdoor space, which is awesome. The grounds are very well kept, the gym is new and huge. The pool area is nice, but small, considering there are several hundred apartments here. Maintenance seemed very efficient when we first moved in, but has become a bit slower to respond. The fact that the apartment walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling can be a bit of an issue at times. This is one of the reasons we are moving out. The other reason is that the value isn't great. You can get a lot more for your money in other areas, a bit away from downtown. We haven't had noise issues from partying students in this building, which is in general pretty quiet. The main noise problem comes from the apartment above us, which is probably not the fault of the tenant, but the lack of insulation between the floors. I was told that there is no concrete layer between floors in this building. When the tenant above us walks around, it sounds like he/she is stomping as hard as they can. It also frequently sounds as if a bowling ball is being rolled across the floor:-0 This problem is made worse since the &quot;stomping&quot; can be heard very often way past midnight, and very early (5-6) in the morning. The location is great if you like to be able to walk to bars and restaurants downtown, and the Carolina Theatre and DPAC. There is also a running track at Duke East Campus, about a 5 min walk away. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Have lived at West Village for almost a year in the Cooper Shop #604 building.

Background: I'm a Duke graduate student/young professional living in a 2BR apartment at West Village. Cons: 1. Smelly halls- At West Village, we must pay for trash service. Just imagine the smell of rotten food, feces, and other unpleasantness as you walk through the halls to get to your apartment. Some days are worse than others. I almost puked multiple times. Quite embarrassing when you invite guest over. 2. Loft rooms- The bedroom walls don't go all the way to the roof. I knew this fact coming into the apartment, so I was slightly more prepared to deal with the noise. However, I recommend that you are absolutely positive that you are willing to live under these circumstances because you can hear everything your roommate does. I mean EVERYTHING! 3. Thin walls- Particularly Thurs-Sat, you often hear people (likely Duke undergrads) in the middle of night getting back from a bibulous time. I work in the morning, so my Friday mornings were a bit brutal. 4. Mold- I live in an older building at WV. The windows facing the outside were extremely moldy. Gross. We did our best to keep it clean, but it kept coming back. 5. Security guards- The leasing staff is friendly, but some of the security guards are rude. On an occasion, I overheard the guards sharing private info (more like talking crap) with each other about some of the tenants. Also, if you ask them for any assistance, you sometimes get a condescending response. 6. Parking- The availability of parking has shrunk considerably since I moved in. For instance, the gravel lot was reduced by about half (Duke reserved the other spots). Also, you can no longer park on Fernway St for more than 2 hours. WV is building a new complex, so unless they make more parking space, good luck finding a spot. Pros: 1. Location- Can't beat the location. In middle of Downtown Durham, you have access to restaurants, bars, American Tobacco, etc. 2. Amenities- Nice gym, pool, BBQ areas, business center. 3. Maintenance- The staff responded quickly to my maintenance issues. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Opinion: You can get the same amenities at a cheaper price within reasonable distance to downtown and Duke somewhere else.

Maintenance- The staff responded quickly to my maintenance issues. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3169168" data-review-id="111337377"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111337377"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111318483" data-beginyear="2013" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20140502"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2013 - 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/02/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;ve lived in several apartments&#44; and even though West Village is a nice apartment in regards to features&#44; amenities&#44; etc. there are many frustrations to living at West Village.

I&#39;ve been here for 3 months and it&#39;s been nothing but a positive experience. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3120345" data-review-id="111275827"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111275827"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111273546" data-beginyear="2013" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20140225"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2013 - 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/25/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> The staff was incredibly helpful in finding an apartment that met our needs and budget.

I would highly recommend a West Village apartment to any friend and will continue leasing with them through out my time in Durham. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3110206" data-review-id="111263753"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111263753"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111263718" data-beginyear="2014" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20140209"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/09/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> The location is great!

I&#39;m pretty happy with my decision to move in here! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3109584" data-review-id="111263147"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111263147"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111263128" data-beginyear="2013" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20140207"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2013 - 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/07/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> This is an amazing place to live.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be here for years to follow. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3108570" data-review-id="111262173"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="111262173"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111261516" data-beginyear="2010" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20140205"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2010 - 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/05/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I have been living in West Village for the past four years and it is a wonderful place to live.

We&#39;ve lived here several years&#44; and generally like our apartment. The closets are a bit small and the appliances aren&#39;t great&#44; but the hardwood floors and high ceilings are nice. The location is good&#44; as well. About a year and a half ago&#44; however&#44; Bell Partners took over as the property management company. Since then&#44; it seems like every week brings a new headache. Parking is horrible: they demolished a parking lot that accounted for 2/3rds of the overall available spaces in order to build more apartments. They supposedly implemented a new parking policy&#44; but it&#39;s never enforced. If you arrive after 6pm&#44; you&#39;ll probably have to park across the street in a poorly lit gravel lot where several robberies have occurred in the past 6 weeks. The other option is to pay $30 a month to park in a parking garage. Whatever &#34;rent&#34; amount you are quoted by the front office&#44; be sure to add at least $50 to account for various fees. Residents are forced to pay $30 per month for basic cable&#44; without any ability to opt-out (not including internet or anything). You&#39;ll also have to pay $20 per month for a trash pick up service. This would be mildly convenient if the hallways didn&#39;t reek of rotten produce most of the time. Also&#44; if you plan on getting a pet&#44; expect to pay $300 up front (which I believe is a fee&#44; not a deposit) PLUS a monthly fee per pet. Safety is also an issue&#44; and for some reason the management doesn&#39;t seem terribly concerned. It&#39;s not that I&#39;d expect the management to prevent every little thing from happening&#44; but they could at least let residents know that they should be concerned. As I mentioned&#44; there have been several armed robberies in recent weeks. How do I know that? Other residents had to tell me&#44; because the front office didn&#39;t bother to alert anyone. For some reason they send ~3 emails per week about random social events&#44; but they&#39;re unwilling to alert residents about safety issues that actually matter. If I were you&#44; I&#39;d rent elsewhere. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> West Village would be a great place to live&#44; were it not for the terrible management company.

I would definitely recommend West Village. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1421087" data-review-id="111190254"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response " data-response-id="817366"><div class="responseTitle"> westvillage2 <span class="reviewDate">10/16/2013</span></div><p>We are so pleased you have found a ?Home? with us at West Village.

Besides the thin walls&#44; where every high heel and cough (my neighbor once said &#39;bless you&#39; to me) can be heard&#44; the constant outside door issues (electronic lock broken&#44; door jammed)&#44; the constant construction&#44; and the lack of parking available nearby (that doesn&#39;t cost an additional $35)&#44; the service quality has been the most frustrating aspect of my time here.

To have a service call initiated&#44; each case required a physical office visit. During the last visit&#44; maintenance locked me out of my apartment. Ok&#44; company policy to lock for liability reasons - no problem&#44; but shouldn&#39;t I be aware that you even entered my apartment or locked the door while I was in the courtyard reading? I simple phone call would suffice. Need a key made? Sure&#44; no problem&#44; we&#39;ll call you back...nope&#44; they didn&#39;t. I received a call from my bud to ask why I never got in touch about the package he sent me...well bud&#44; the reason why is because West Villages held onto it for 3 months without so much as a phone call&#44; email&#44; or note. There may be safety issues (judging from the notes and emails received)&#44; but welcome to Durham - can&#39;t really hold West Villages liable for that as they have a security officer and keep the place locked up. Lastly&#44; there&#39;s the constant debris falling off my brick walls and the one-time water leak that damaged a painting and my sofa - this isn&#39;t common in West Villages from what I understand&#44; but note that the renter&#39;s insurance you&#39;re required to have is to cover West&#39;s liability during guests accidents or falls&#44; not to replace your damaged property. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> My experience at West Villages has been sub-par at best.

To have a service call initiated&#44; each case required a physical office visit. During the last visit&#44; maintenance locked me out of my apartment. Ok&#44; company policy to lock for liability reasons - no problem&#44; but shouldn&#39;t I be aware that you even entered my apartment or locked the door while I was in the courtyard reading? I simple phone call would suffice. Need a key made? Sure&#44; no problem&#44; we&#39;ll call you back...nope&#44; they didn&#39;t. I received a call from my bud to ask why I never got in touch about the package he sent me...well bud&#44; the reason why is because West Villages held onto it for 3 months without so much as a phone call&#44; email&#44; or note. There may be safety issues (judging from the notes and emails received)&#44; but welcome to Durham - can&#39;t really hold West Villages liable for that as they have a security officer and keep the place locked up. Lastly&#44; there&#39;s the constant debris falling off my brick walls and the one-time water leak that damaged a painting and my sofa - this isn&#39;t common in West Villages from what I understand&#44; but note that the renter&#39;s insurance you&#39;re required to have is to cover West&#39;s liability during guests accidents or falls&#44; not to replace your damaged property. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3037889" data-review-id="111182756"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response " data-response-id="813801"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">10/02/2013</span></div><p>My Staff and I appreciate your feedback concerning your stay here at West Village.

We&#39;ve always lived in &#34;Phase 2&#34; - first in Cobb&#44; and now in OCF. We were able to break our lease when we were in Cobb and I was laid off&#44; a few years ago&#44; and sign a new lease in OCF&#44; we were grateful at the time to the management company. While we loved our Cobb apartment&#44; we did have a few&#44; but bearable&#44; inconveniences. Since moving across the street to OCF&#44; West Village changed management companies. The new management company has been absolutely horrible. I&#39;ve been waiting 2 days to have a simple lightbulb changed (I&#39;d do it myself but don&#39;t have a tall enough ladder to reach the bulb). The old gym was closed before the new gym has yet to open&#44; and&#44; there isn&#39;t any date when it will open&#44; but we&#39;ve been hearing for over a month that new gym is &#34;coming soon&#34;. A new parking permit policy was put into place but isn&#39;t enforced. They&#39;ve shut down a big parking lot in front of the O&#39;Brien building in order to build a &#34;Phase 3&#34; building&#44; however we&#39;ve been told it will still be &#34;a few weeks&#34; before any parking enforcement in other other lots is actually accomplished. So after a long day at work&#44; I might get a spot in the lot&#44; even with my &#34;resident sticker&#34;. When I asked about when the parking &#34;enforcement&#34; was first to go into effect&#44; the young woman in the office simply stated &#34;we&#39;ve sent out a lot of emails&#34; - but I had to ASK QUESTIONS in order to find out that there&#39;d be 3-hour parking for business customers&#44; or that there wouldn&#39;t be any guest parking for residents - none of that was communicated&#44; but the office staff was short and rude about it. You&#39;re also required to pay for &#34;valet trash&#34; - without an option to opt-out. We live across the hall from the trash chute; we&#39;re perfectly capable of taking out our own trash&#44; yet are forced to pay $25/month for someone else to take it from outside our door&#44; and only 5 days a week&#44; not even weekends!! Additionally&#44; now between 6 and 9pm&#44; the hallways are filled with residents&#39; black trash bins&#44; and the hallways smell! Our rent has also gone up over 30&#37; this year. After arguing with the management&#44; we were able to knock that down a bit; after all&#44; we&#39;ve lived here for over 4 years without such a drastic increase. Even though it was higher than we would have liked&#44; we decided to stay as we&#39;re likely moving out of state next year and didn&#39;t want to move somewhere else in Durham for just one year. The walls can seem thin at times&#44; but from what I&#39;ve heard&#44; &#34;Phase 1&#34; is much worse. I&#39;ve knocked on upstairs or next door neighbors doors and asked them to turn a TV or music down&#44; on occasion&#44; and people are generally amicable about it - after all&#44; we&#39;re all in the same situation. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We moved here 5 years ago&#44; and fell in love with the complex. We&#39;ve always lived in &#34;Phase 2&#34; - first in Cobb&#44; and now in OCF. We were able to break our lease when we were in Cobb and I was laid off&#44; a few years ago&#44; and sign a new lease in OCF&#44; we were grateful at the time to the management company. While we loved our Cobb apartment&#44; we did have a few&#44; but bearable&#44; inconveniences. Since moving across the street to OCF&#44; West Village changed management companies. The new management company has been absolutely horrible.

I hate to leave West Village! It has been a great experience. The staff is always so nice and very helpful. Maintenance is always very quick to respond to any work orders and the location is amazing! I am able to walk to most of my favorite local hang outs and my friends are always commenting on how beautiful my apartment is! Parking has gotten a little tough since they will be using one of the lots to build a brand new building. They do offer covered parking in the parking garage right next door to my building. It is a very reasonable price so I have purchased one and have not had any issues with parking. I plan to visit Durham often after my move so I am looking forward to seeing the new building and all that it has to offer! West Village has been renovating tons of stuff since the new management company took over a year or so ago. We are getting a new gym&#44; I&#39;ve noticed new furniture and their new leasing office is gorgeous! I would definitely recommend West Village if you love the downtown feel&#44; saving gas and loving where you live! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I have lived at West Village for two years and have just recently given my notice to moved out due to my job transfer.

I hate to leave West Village! It has been a great experience. The staff is always so nice and very helpful. Maintenance is always very quick to respond to any work orders and the location is amazing! I am able to walk to most of my favorite local hang outs and my friends are always commenting on how beautiful my apartment is! Parking has gotten a little tough since they will be using one of the lots to build a brand new building. They do offer covered parking in the parking garage right next door to my building. It is a very reasonable price so I have purchased one and have not had any issues with parking. I plan to visit Durham often after my move so I am looking forward to seeing the new building and all that it has to offer! West Village has been renovating tons of stuff since the new management company took over a year or so ago. We are getting a new gym&#44; I&#39;ve noticed new furniture and their new leasing office is gorgeous! I would definitely recommend West Village if you love the downtown feel&#44; saving gas and loving where you live! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"><a class="photoGallery" href="#"><img class="resident-image gtmEventData_0" alt="(Resident photo)" data-review-photo="true" data-image-id="qTQryDd7h81.jpg" src="//cimg0.ibsrv.net/ibimg/www.apartmentratings.com/90x60_60-1-fffbg/qTQryDd7h81.jpg" /></a></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2963293" data-review-id="1672933"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="1672933"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1672412" data-beginyear="2012" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="0" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20130606"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2012 - 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/06/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> The building I&#39;m in is part of phase II and I don&#39;t suffer the noise issues that others in some of the earlier buildings do.

Is it perfect? No&#44; but I absolutely love it here&#44; and the only reason I&#39;m moving out is I&#39;m leaving the state. Yes&#44; the rent is high. Get over it. The apartments are gorgeous. Ridiculously high ceilings&#44; granite countertops&#44; stainless steel appliances&#44; beautiful floors&#44; and enormous windows. I do get the feeling the contractor fell asleep when designing the bathrooms but oh well. I will probably never again live in a building as cool as this one and will miss my apt terribly. The noise is *occasionally* a problem. I live in the newer phase II building Cobb&#44; so I think we have much less noise problems than the phase I buildings. That being said&#44; I do hear my neighbors having sex and used to hear them playing board games like I was in the room. This only applies to one side of my apartment though. I *never* hear the neighbors on the other side. Who knows why. Once in a while I&#39;ll hear the people above walking around but not much more than that. For the most part though&#44; it is quiet. I have found everything clean&#44; and the small gym is great and adequate for me&#44; especially with the free wifi. Yes&#44; there was recently a changeover in management. I haven&#39;t noticed anything all that different frankly. Tons of free parking in the lot&#44; but I pay $35 a month for the garage because I&#39;m paranoid. I believe most of the newer units come with W/D inside the apartments. Very dog friendly community. I can&#39;t say anything about the pool because I&#39;ve never been in it. The fireplace is fake but still fun to turn on. Tons of natural light&#44; even from having only one window (albeit&#44; a very large one). I love the floor plan&#44; long like you would find in SF&#44; with no direct ceiling on the bedroom. I love this place. Perhaps it&#39;s overpriced&#44; but you won&#39;t find much else like it. Very unique converted tobacco warehouse. Maintenance is generally pretty good. Occasional noise would be my only complaint. Highly recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for a different living experience and have the money to pay for it.

Is it perfect? No&#44; but I absolutely love it here&#44; and the only reason I&#39;m moving out is I&#39;m leaving the state. Yes&#44; the rent is high. Get over it. The apartments are gorgeous. Ridiculously high ceilings&#44; granite countertops&#44; stainless steel appliances&#44; beautiful floors&#44; and enormous windows. I do get the feeling the contractor fell asleep when designing the bathrooms but oh well. I will probably never again live in a building as cool as this one and will miss my apt terribly. The noise is *occasionally* a problem. I live in the newer phase II building Cobb&#44; so I think we have much less noise problems than the phase I buildings. That being said&#44; I do hear my neighbors having sex and used to hear them playing board games like I was in the room. This only applies to one side of my apartment though.

The worst part about the apartments is the noise. I&#39;m sitting here writing this&#44; and I can hear my upstairs neighbor&#39;s entire conversation. When they watch TV&#44; it&#39;s like I&#39;m watching their TV. When they walk down the hall&#44; I sometimes wonder if someone is in my apartment. The company who turned this building into apartments did NOTHING to control for noise&#44; and it&#39;s obvious. You hear your neighbors dog&#44; you hear their screaming child&#44; you hear EVERYTHING. It honestly makes you feel crazy. For what you pay here&#44; it&#39;s just not acceptable to have to deal with the noise. The developers really missed out on an opportunity to make these livable. Instead they just churn people in and out after 1 year because no one wants to renew their lease. Secondly&#44; the leasing office has continued to disappoint me. They play favorites with residents&#44; (meaning they let some residents get away with having pets without paying fees&#44; and then are unsympathetic to other residents requests) are surprisingly uneducated about the property and basic questions like &#34;Can I pay my rent online&#34; often end with incorrect answers. They always tell you they&#39;ll look into something. And never do. There is one woman in the office who I trust for answers&#44; but other than that&#44; they&#39;re all incompetent. Their handyman is amazing. Seriously&#44; they need to keep that guy b/c he&#39;s really all they got going for them. He fixes things immediately. And usually leaves a nice note on your counter.

The question of whether or not I would recommend this complex to others is mostly dependent upon what you want out of your home. I personally would not however had renewed my lease if I was going to stay in the area (I ended up moving out of the state). Pros: -- Great Location - If you are in need to be close to Duke or love the nightlife&#44; this is a great location. The university is close by and there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. -- Great Visuals - The complex is a series of old warehouses used to store and roll tobacco (don t worry&#44; there&#39;s no lingering smell). The apartments have exposed wood and steel beams which really make the place stand out. -- Upscale amenities - In my apartment I had all stainless steel appliances&#44; wood floors&#44; granite counter tops&#44; and washer/dryer in the unit. These features however do cost a pretty penny to have. -- Maintenance and Office Staff - Any maintenance requests I had were always completed in a timely manner and the staff were friendly. In addition the office staff were friendly and knew me by name. -- Security - While no setup is ever perfect&#44; I always felt quite safe in the building. Depending on where you entered in the building you would have to pass through one to three locked doors needing either a code or card to gain entry. Cons: -- Noise - They really should have spent more money on noise isolation when they divided the buildings into apartments. You can easily hear your neighbors having conversations and doing their daily routines in the apartments next to you. It is said that phase one is worse than phase two&#44; however I lived in phase two so it must be really bad over in phase one. Additionally you can hear the neighbors above walking around due to the way the building was originally built. This can become quite maddening at times. -- Cost - Due to the location and amenities offered you will pay a premium price to live here. For me I didn t consider it worth the cost in the end&#44; but some may disagree if the location means a lot to them. -- Gym Equipment - The times that I used the gym&#44; there were always machines that were broken or otherwise worn out. However&#44; the machines that did work worked fine for my use and it was never crowded. -- Return of Security Deposit - The managing company did not send out my security deposit within the 30 day window required by law. I had sent them an email regarding the missing refund&#44; however they did not reply to my message. I then received the check for the refund the next week&#44; coincidentally postmarked two days after I had sent them the email asking it s status. They did however refund the full amount that was owed and I didn t need to take things further. Other thoughts: The management changed in early 2012 however I didn t see much of a difference in quality other than the changing of some of the office staff. I see some people on here complaining that it went downhill&#44; however I didn t notice that. I can t comment on the pool as I never tried it; It was closed shortly after I moved in for the winter and I otherwise just never got around to it. As for parking&#44; I didn t have any issues due to the times I came and went&#44; however if you arrive in the late evenings on the weekends it may be difficult to find an open parking space. This is due to the parking lot being used by visitors to the downtown area. As I said previously&#44; while I wouldn t have stayed here another year personally&#44; it is possible others may see it as a good value due to its amenities and location. I recommend you do all of the research yourself and check out their apartments before deciding for&#44; or against West Village. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I leased a one bedroom apartment from West Village for one year&#44; and moved out a little over a month ago.

Change is good and the new team will make things better&#44; it just takes some time. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2775445" data-review-id="1492390"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="1492390"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1482425" data-beginyear="2012" data-endyear="2012" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20120722"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2012 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 07/22/2012</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> In short?

Don&#39;t usually post reviews but I&#39;ve been so disappointed here that I&#39;ll be posting this review on every West Village review I can find. In full? -Noise transference is the absolute biggest issue across all the different apartment buildings - Phase one and Phase two. From any point in your apartment&#44; upstairs or downstairs if you have a loft&#44; you WILL easily hear your neighbours going about their business in their homes&#44; loud music playing&#44; people talking loudly in all the corridors&#44; etc. Not a problem if you have a quiet neighbour but it easily becomes a problem when pet owners congregate in the hall with their pets or the college kids have a hangout which spills into the corridors. Which tends to happen frequently&#44; especially closer to the weekends. Noise transference also comes in pretty easily from the streets&#44; as well so you hear people talking loudly on their cells as they walk&#44; you hear people hanging out at night... -The pet owners... They can be quite insensitive to the needs of others&#44; and for some reason&#44; West Village seems to be overrun with multiple large dogs per apartment&#44; and small yappy dogs. Makes for a lot of dog noises on a daily basis. I&#39;ve seen/smelled dog pee and feces in the inside hallway carpets&#44; and owners often forget to pick up behind their pets outdoors&#44; leading to lots of flies in the grass outside the apartment windows during the summer. Pet owners sometimes walk their dogs indoors&#44; which leads to a lot of noisy barking and dog-running at all hours of the day/night. They also leave their dogs cooped up inside these tiny apartments for long hours which makes the dogs restless and you can hear them galloping through the apartments overhead. Very annoying when it happens - frequently - at 6 in the morning. - Parking tends to be a nightmare every evening&#44; since it is on a first come basis. There are ample parking spaces around each building&#44; but since West Village seems to share the tenant parking with Durham at large&#44; expect to return home from work at 5:00pm and park in the street&#44; at the very edge of the parking lot (far away from the housing entrances) or even a block away. Spaces that should be reserved for paying West Village tenants tend to be filled up by Durham diners and Amtrack users between 5-10pm most days of the week. - Safety is also a HUGE issue in downtown Durham. The factory style buildings are opened out to the public on all sides&#44; so although one has to have a buzz card to actually enter the apartments&#44; it&#39;s extremely easy for pan-handlers to loiter around the building and eventually sneak in with a tenant or hop the wall by the pool and hang around outside until the doors are open. Sounds far-fetched&#44; but it has happened too many times to count and tenants often have to call the police to get the panhandlers out of the buildings. Furthermore&#44; the beggars and drifters will target tenants as they enter the buildings or walk to their cars - West Village has little by the way of privacy and is too open to the streets. - The apartment themselves are nice enough&#44; but only in the Phase Two buildings&#44; where there are bamboo floors&#44; nice fixtures&#44; etc. However&#44; beware that these are &#39;old&#39; warehouses - they do carry a very musty smell that doesn&#39;t really go away. Also&#44; the walls and exposed beams tend to be quite moldy and presents breathing problems&#44; if you have a reasonably sensitive respiratory system.

I, too, have been living in West Village for several years, and find the new management absolutely unbearable and inefficient. Bell Properties, the new management, seems to be populated by cretins. It took MONTHS for the new management to actually introduce themselves to their tenants. The complex remains filthy. And clean carpets are nothing but a memory of the &quot;golden years&quot; when the old management was truly in charge. This is, of course, quite alarming and glaring, given all the canines that live in West Village. The rugs smell. I hate to think of a possible flea infestation in the hallways, particularly during the summer. Plus they stupidly want to get rid of the &quot;free zone,&quot; which fosters, at one level or another, the notion of community living and good neighborly relations. The new management also bombards tenants with the most banal emails, trying to pass these dumb missives as &quot;neighborly&quot; relations. They should spent their time and energy actually improving the place and valuing tenants who have been living here and making this space a home. The great thing about West Village, I always thought, was the diversity of professionals as well as the different age ranges. It appears that the new management privileges the undergraduate population, and is primarily invested in making this place a glorified dorm. Sadly, I have seen a mass exodus of professionals since this new management took over, and I will soon be one of those taking my rental money elsewhere.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="1444058"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1442043" data-beginyear="2012" data-endyear="2012" data-responses="1" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20120516"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2012 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/16/2012</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I moved from FL to NC and I found this apartment complex it was very close to my work.

Management has been great. Very accommodating and friendly. I also have no complaints about people on my floor and my direct neighbors. People have been in general pretty quiet and the &#34;thin walls&#34; haven&#39;t been much of an issue. It&#39;s just that... well... the reuse of this old tobacco warehouse is great and all&#44; but the apartment floor-plans seem to be a bit poorly executed. The space doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s being used to its potential. It feels inefficient. The unit is a long narrow strip with one tiny window and a 3x3 square sun window. I like large windows&#44; I love sunlight&#44; and unfortunately&#44; this place is too dark for my taste. Some friends live over in the Hicks building and their floor-plan was created in a much more efficient way. Not as narrow&#44; more &#34;squat&#44;&#34; the floor-plan at hicks overall feels like more of an open space as opposed to a narrow hall. I might add&#44; I do love the fact I haven&#39;t had to turn on my heater ONCE this Winter. Stay&#39;s pretty warm and cozy in the Toms building. (Good thing too&#44; cause the ceilings are high enough to make heating the area a nightmare.) With that said&#44; it&#39;s in a great location where you can walk to all kinds of different businesses that&#39;ll keep ya fed&#44; keep ya drunk&#44; and keep ya entertained. Check it out&#44; decide for yourself&#44; and please... ask to see as many floor-plan variations as you can. They are definitely not all the same.

About a week after moving in&#44; I was fast asleep one night&#44; probably dreaming about David Beckham or cheesecake&#44; and was suddenly startled awake at 2am by what can only be described as the unmistakable sounds of some girl getting boned next door. No lie&#44; I thought someone was in my bedroom -- it was THAT loud. I think the builders must have put a sheet of drywall between the two places and that s about it. The sound carries so well&#44; in fact&#44; that I can distinctly hear the play-by-play of every sexual encounter this dude has -- and worst of all&#44; I can&#39;t escape it. All I can do is lay in bed with a pillow over my head trying to block out the sounds of unadulterated&#44; albeit abbreviated passion. I&#39;d say my neighbor must be a total stud because he gets laid all of the time&#44; but my saving grace is that his exploits only last about three minutes and then end abruptly (which is why&#44; I can only assume&#44; he always has a different girl). Another bonus of his decided non-studliness is that I never have to hear any of his conquests&#44; well . . . finish. I d have probably moved out by now if I had to be subjected to that as well. After all&#44; there is nothing worse than being jarred awake in the dead of night only to lie in bed&#44; alone with your cats&#44; watching with bloodshot eyes as the bright red numbers of your digital alarm clock tick away while you are forced to endure the echoes of ecstasy being had by someone else. My one consolation is knowing that it ain t that great. And -- Joe Neighbor&#44; if I may take the liberty of answering your routine post-coital query on behalf of the chick in your bed who is trying so diligently to mask her profound disappointment: No&#44; it wasn t as good for her as it was for you. But aside from the penetrating sound issues (pun kind of intended)&#44; West Village is a really cool complex with friendly staff&#44; nice (however rabidly horny) residents&#44; etc. Also&#44; the new Durham rocks&#44; and the location of this place is awesome. Nevertheless&#44; none of this outweighs the noise factor. This is something I simply cannot bear&#44; and so I am moving out in a few weeks -- and unfortunately&#44; some other poor&#44; unsuspecting soul who moves into my place is going to have to suffer through the resonating pleasure proclamations of his/her new neighbors regular rendezvous.

Once the novelty of the exposed brick walls&#44; thirty foot ceilings and bamboo floors wears off you&#39;re left with a dark and loud apartment. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2537707" data-review-id="1280671"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="1280671"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1253818" data-beginyear="2009" data-endyear="2011" data-responses="1" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20110518"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2009 - 2011 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/18/2011</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;ve lived in West Village apartments for 2 years. When I first moved in&#44; I was enamored by the high ceilings&#44; exposed brick loft-style apartments. However&#44; think carefully and consider your other options before signing with West Village: 1. The leasing office management is terrible. On the surface they seem like sweet ladies&#44; but they are unaccommodating sharks who do nothing for the tenant and everything to turn their own profit. They pretend to care about the tenants when in reality they are inflexible&#44; apathetic&#44; and unorganized. They did not understand the concept of following through on an issue and it would often take me and my roommate multiple attempts (and speaking with multiple people) to get an issue resolved. 2. The sound insulation is unbearable. I could hear not only my upstairs neighbors&#39; every step&#44; but also my downstairs neighbors talking&#44; and people in the hallways and stairwells. If your neighbor has a pet or a party&#44; it will sound like it&#39;s in your own apartment. I don&#39;t sleep or wake particularly early&#44; but still it was unbearable. They will tell you only Phase I has this issue&#44; but you can hear your neighbors play music and walk around in Phase II apartments as well. 3. The amenities are nothing compared to what you could get at Station 9&#44; the Lofts&#44; or Trinity Commons. There is a gym but it&#39;s tiny and old and has very limited machines (compared to Station 9 which has new equipment and an indoor a basketball court). The pool is also very small. The conference room has 5 computers&#44; only 2 of which work. They also started charging for coffee this year -- not a single other apartment complex in the area does that. All in all&#44; you get what you pay for. Actually&#44; you get a little less than you pay for. The individual apartments are nice&#44; but prepare to hear a lot of noise/get a lot of noise complaints. The maintenance guys are helpful&#44; but the leasing office is incompetent&#44; unorganized&#44; and selfish. Don&#39;t live here if you&#39;re a family or a college student who wants to have parties occasionally&#44; or if you expect comprehensive service from the leasing management. For the same price range&#44; go with Station 9 or the new Trinity Commons instead. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I&#39;ve lived in West Village apartments for 2 years.

so on some of the bedrooms the walls don&#39;t go up to the ceiling. not as much privacy if you&#39;re sharing an apartment). plenty of room&#44; loved the high ceilings&#44; granite countertops&#44; excellent appliances. for such a big apartment (around 1100 sq. ft.) utilities were fairly cheap (around $120 a month for electric and water) the apartments are all renovated warehouses&#44; and my roommate and I loved having two brick walls in our living room. however&#44; you have to give up a little to get the cool old warehouse feel - dirt sometimes falls off the walls (when we moved our couch against the brick wall the back was always covered in dust)&#44; and the ventilation system goes from apartment to apartment&#44; so I had a very easy time hearing everything that was happening with my neighbor (my roommate&#44; however&#44; didn&#39;t hear a thing&#44; so must depend on where your vent actually goes). rain is also pretty loud on the rooftop because it&#39;s flat. I loved this&#44; but others may not. staff was incredibly friendly&#44; very helpful and very laid back. always said hi when you saw them around. my roommate went out of town for a while and forgot to pay her garage parking&#44; they were very nice about it&#44; no late fees or anything. maintenance was fairly prompt&#44; although takes a few days for a request. the ceilings are VERY high so unless you have a ladder&#44; you can&#39;t change the light bulbs yourself&#44; which gets annoying because the fans are always shaking them loose. maintenance will fix them for you&#44; but you have to wait&#44; and our apartment had no windows in the bedrooms = very dark for a day or two. lots of free parking&#44; however if you get there late on a weeknight during the year&#44; you may have to park far away or &#34;make up&#34; your own space. never had a problem with towing when this happened&#44; and other tenants are respectful and don&#39;t box others in. they said they had an after hours courtesy patrol if you felt unsafe walking around. I never had to use it&#44; but it was nice to know it was there because muggings do occur occassionally in the area. never heard about one happening actually at the complex&#44; but a few blocks away. my apartments required two key card swipes to enter&#44; so I always felt safe in that respect. overall a wonderful experience. really cool apartments and really great people. highly recommended. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> lived here my senior year (wanted to get away from the &#34;fratty&#34; feel a lot of complexes around duke have). was a great experience. the apartment (in the COBB building) was fantastic&#44; two bedroom two bath with walls to the ceiling (watch out&#44; some apartments are in the &#34;loft style&#34; so on some of the bedrooms the walls don&#39;t go up to the ceiling. not as much privacy if you&#39;re sharing an apartment). plenty of room&#44; loved the high ceilings&#44; granite countertops&#44; excellent appliances. for such a big apartment (around 1100 sq. ft.) utilities were fairly cheap (around $120 a month for electric and water) the apartments are all renovated warehouses&#44; and my roommate and I loved having two brick walls in our living room. however&#44; you have to give up a little to get the cool old warehouse feel - dirt sometimes falls off the walls (when we moved our couch against the brick wall the back was always covered in dust)&#44; and the ventilation system goes from apartment to apartment&#44; so I had a very easy time hearing everything that was happening with my neighbor (my roommate&#44; however&#44; didn&#39;t hear a thing&#44; so must depend on where your vent actually goes). rain is also pretty loud on the rooftop because it&#39;s flat.

I never had to use it&#44; but it was nice to know it was there because muggings do occur occassionally in the area. never heard about one happening actually at the complex&#44; but a few blocks away. my apartments required two key card swipes to enter&#44; so I always felt safe in that respect. overall a wonderful experience. really cool apartments and really great people. highly recommended. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2242899" data-review-id="1095305"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="1095305"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1073322" data-beginyear="2010" data-endyear="2010" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20100503"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2010 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/03/2010</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> beautiful apartments and the apartment staff is amazing but ...

Both were in the Phase I area&#44; so my comments might not apply to whatever newer unit you&#39;re lookng at. Something that&#39;s interesting about West Village is that unlike every other apartment I&#39;ve ever known&#44; it attracts all ages of people (generally provided that they&#39;re childless). Rather than being a quiet unit mostly filled with seniors&#44; or a raucous unit full of college students&#44; you get a very interesting mix of people who often have nothing in common&#44; ha ha. I&#39;m all for diversity&#44; but as a young professional&#44; I found it very obnoxious to pay the rent that I did for the privilege of listening to spoiled college students (I&#39;m a Duke alumna myself&#44; but my parents sure weren&#39;t paying for me to live in WV) traipse drunkenly all over the building&#44; while getting the sound police called on me by presumably older folk during a quiet dinner gathering. Although I know of several young professionals still living in West Village&#44; I always sort of got the impression that the place was not made for people like myself. I&#39;ve heard many people talk about safety on this board. I didn&#39;t feel unsafe living here at all&#44; except my bicycle was stolen right out of the closed and monitored bike area. I wondered how this was even possible&#44; to the point where I wondered if perhaps I&#39;d left my bike somewhere else&#44; until my neighbor&#39;s bike got stolen later that week&#44; and when he pursued some sort of answer&#44; all he got was that this was a common complaint. This was two years ago&#44; so perhaps something has been done about this. My main issue with WV was probably the insulation. I didn&#39;t bother buying a television because I could hear my neighbors&#39; at all times&#44; and I assume that they were being played at a reasonable volume. I never dared listen to music without headphones. I&#39;m a pretty relaxed person and rarely mind noise from the neighbors -- I knew when I moved in that this was a known issue and expected it. What I did not expect was that I would wind up living in fear of noise violations for the slightest activity of my own. Once&#44; I had three friends over for dinner at 9pm on a friday. There was no music&#44; no drinking&#44; just 4 adults sharing conversation within inches of each other. A security officer gruffly knocked on my door and informed me that we were being too loud. I apologized and told my guests&#44; who were astounded and a little creeped out that anyone could hear us outside the apartment. We immediately dropped our voices to practically a whisper&#44; and in less than 10 minutes&#44; the officer was back&#44; this time incredibly rude to us. I lived on the first floor&#44; we were talking at below-normal volume&#44; and it was early on a Friday night -- even if we were being a little louder&#44; which is really not the case&#44; it seemed like an appropriate time and setting to entertain guests without disturbing the lives of the neighbors too much. One other thing that may be worth noting is that it may be worth considering if you have allergies. I never knew that I did&#44; but developed what my optometrist diagnosed as allergic conjunctivitis when I was living in WV. I noticed that occasionally if I slept somewhere else&#44; I&#39;d wake up with clear eyes&#44; so I invested in a better vacuum cleaner and cleaned my apartment even more psychotically than I typically do&#44; hoping it would make a difference. It didn&#39;t&#44; but my eye problem disappeared the day I moved out. I suspect that maybe all those open rafters are hard to really keep dust free. If you do elect to rent a WV apartment&#44; I would try to find a unit that doesn&#39;t restrict your bed placement to an area directly under a vent -- I suspect that exacerbated the problem I had. All in all&#44; West Village provides many nice perks (free coffee&#44; 24-hour assistance number&#44; office hours on the weekends)&#44; so if you&#39;re looking for a little extra pampering&#44; it might be a great fit for you. In my experience&#44; however&#44; the management&#39;s extra involvement in my life proved more of a liability than a treat. My current apartment is much less attentive&#44; but it&#39;s also much cheaper&#44; much more insulated&#44; and the residents much less uptight. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I lived in two units in West Village over the span of about 3 years.

This person says that West Village is not meant for young professionals - as a young professional myself I feel very comfortable and welcome here. I've met lots of young professionals and people of all different backgrounds at west village. I would also say that the buildings are old warehouses - they were built over 100 years ago but they are really well maintained and the maintenance staff is awesome. I've lived here for a few years and although I do have allergies I know it has nothing to do with my apartment. Downtown warehouse living isn't for everyone but if you like downtown, historic buildings, and friendly, effecient management - West Village is the place.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="949734"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="933656" data-beginyear="2009" data-endyear="2009" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20090606"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2009 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/06/2009</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;m an older professional woman who lived in Phase II (Cobb) for 10 months (2008-09) and thought it was just spectacular: beautiful&#44; friendly&#44; mostly quiet (when there wasn&#39;t construction going on)&#44; nicely located (walking distance from a variety of restaurants&#44; Brightleaf&#44; the bus and train stations&#44; the YMCA&#44; pubs and the West End Wine Bar&#44; the farmers&#39; market&#44; a good film theater and other cultural centers).

People tend to either love it or hate it, depending on their unit, building, and what they're comparing it to. The &quot;haters&quot; tend to be students and young adults from the Toms &amp; Hicks building, comparing it to garden apartments. It could easily seem overpriced and relatively unsafe from that point of view. Those with larger apartments in the other buildings and/or have lived downtown in other cities see it as safe, friendly, and a good buy. I can tell you we've lived here over 5 years, and our car has never been broken into. There is a new garage, and I'd highly recommend that anyone with a convertible spring for a space in it.

It seems like WV learned things from Phase I and applied them to Phase II. They were able to greatly reduce the noise by acoustically insulating each unit.

These people are stealing car stereos. Unfortunately you cannot take your car stereo with you and not all of us have expensive new cars w/ alarm systems. Besides, I've lived plenty of places where I have left things in my locked car &amp; NEVER have had my car broken into. In addition, my car has a convertible top that was cut one night apparently for fun because there was nothing in my car to take. This had been the 2nd time my top had been cut. The 1st time was to steal my radio. So needless to say my top has been replaced 2x's. Just last month 2 more cars were broken into once again right outside our entrance door &amp; the drivers side windows were smashed in. Another car completely vandalized w/ a brick just to take a boxed office chair.I should not have to CONSTANTLY worry about my car &amp; belongs not being safe, especially for what I'm paying in rent.

I mean, for Pete's sake, I can hear entire conversations happening next door! I have to be afraid of what I say in my own apartment because they can almost certainly hear me too!

I miss my loft.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="822997"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="818729" data-beginyear="2008" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20080826"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 08/26/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> First off&#44; the management has been very nice and helpful. I saw some reviews from the past say that management was awful&#44; but I&#39;ve had nothing but good experiences with them. Perhaps they have changed in those 4-5 years. There is plenty of parking&#44; but it is really far from some of the apartments. This ties into safety - once you are in the complex&#44; it is very safe because it is gated and coded&#44; but waking from the parking areas to the gates can be a little unsettling at night. NOISE - Do you like hearing your neighbors have loud sex EVERY NIGHT? Do you like to hear your neighbor&#39;s Guitar Hero parties like they&#39;re happening in YOUR OWN APARTMENT? Do you like to hear every conversation your neighbor has or every television show they watch? If so&#44; this is the place for you. If not&#44; then stay far away... I know for a fact that Hicks building and Toms Building are AWFUL for this problem; I&#39;m not sure about Flowers and the Garage. BUT SERIOUSLY&#44; NOISE IS AN AWFUL PROBLEM. They built these apartments from the bottom up... why couldn&#39;t they include sound insulation? DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR SUCH A PROBLEM TO EXIST. Grounds - They&#39;re pretty&#44; but I don&#39;t live on the grounds. I live in an apartment&#44; so I just don&#39;t really care about grounds. Construction - some of the fixtures in the apartments are just awful. The mirrored closet doors are shoddy as heck&#44; fall out of track all the time&#44; get stuck&#44; etc. Toilet innards seem to break WAY too often (thus messing up your water bill). The noise issue is just horrific&#44; as I already said. Maintenance - The maintenance people have always been fast and very helpful. Overall&#44; I&#39;d say don&#39;t live here for more than a few months. It&#39;s great if you&#39;re between living situations&#44; but to sign a year-long lease and then find yourself with loud sex next door every night&#44; a leaky toilet all the time&#44; and parking a quarter mile away at night... you don&#39;t want to be stuck with that for a year. It&#39;s a tolerable place for a short time&#44; but that&#39;s about it. Also&#44; it is SO expensive for what you get... If there weren&#39;t the noise problems and the shoddy fixtures&#44; I really would feel like the price was fair and I&#39;d have no problem with it... after all&#44; I did sign up to live there ;) But&#44; now that I have to live with the problems&#44; it&#39;s not worth it.

I&#39;m picky and this place has definitely met all my expectations. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1778517" data-review-id="809677"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="809677"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="791526" data-beginyear="2008" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20080628"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/28/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I was in Durham for four months and lived in one of West Villages corporate apartments.

I have to wonder if there is a larger story there and we are just getting a dose of vitriol because something didn&#39;t go their way. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1149867" data-review-id="683087"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="683087"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="638683" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2005" data-responses="2" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20070625"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/25/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I lived in the West Village in 2005. When I first checked out the apartments&#44; I was very impressed. I loved the exposed brick and wooden beams in the room that gave the West Village great character&#44; especially compared to the multitude of ugly garden style buildings in Durham. The prices didn&#39;t seem too bad either for the large size of the apartment. However&#44; within about a month of living there&#44; I knew a made a big mistake. As mentioned in previous posts&#44; there is no noise insulation so you can hear everything going on in your neighbors&#39; apartments. The residents below me came to my door at least 10 times during the year to tell me not to walk in my own apartment with shoes and to not talk too loudly. I was horrified when the next door neighbor was able to tell me every television program I watch because he was able to hear everything through the walls. Next&#44; the ceiling in my apartment leaked throughout the entire year despite the management&#39;s attempt to &#34;fix&#34; the problem (The Tom&#39;s building has a big problem with leaking). A lot of my clothes and books were destroyed and the carpet in one of the rooms smelled like mold as a result. The heating and air conditioning systems are poorly installed and there was no real climate control. Again&#44; I brought this up to management and they were not able to do anything about it. A lot of people in the building are really snobby (including the management) and I always felt I was walking on eggshells with them. They somehow thought they were living in some fancy loft apartment in the West Village&#44; Manhattan instead of the West Village&#44; Durham&#44; North Carolina. Some other posts mentioned how the building manager will find any way to deny returning your housing deposit. This is true. I spent a solid week making sure the place was spotless before I left because some of my friends that lived there and moved out earlier hadn&#39;t received their deposits for minor things like leaving a couple items in the fridge. Yet&#44; despite my efforts&#44; I never saw a dime of my deposit again. One last thing&#44; the area is not safe at night and you will be a target since the upscale West Village is in an economically depressed neighborhood. Be careful. Please stay away from this place as it will only cause headaches and frustration. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I lived in the West Village in 2005.

I love the architecture and really wanted to make living there work out, but I wholeheartedly agree with every word of this well written commentary. My next door neighboor used to knock on my door many nights a week and recite lines from Friends. &quot;No, Phoebe, I love the cat song.&quot; My TV was not loud. Even the angry neighboor agreed that IN my bedroom the TV was not loud, but the Hicks building has drywall between apartments not solid walls. Also, I agree that a lot of the people who live there consider themselves uppercrusty and it does not make for a friendly living environment (despite being really beautiful in the daytime). I too did not get my security deposit back even though both apartments looked better when I moved out!</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="152741"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/26/2007</span></div><p>Wow!! This must be the noisy, rude neighbor that lived above me. Ran his dishwasher at 11PM, purchased a puppy and played fetch up and down the hall. Management was nice enough to pay for my move into another quiet downstairs apartment without a rude neighbor above me. I continued to live at West Village for another two years and recently moved out. I enjoyed the community and friendly, knowlegdeable office staff. Of course things broke in my apartment but maintenance was in to repair that day or the next. Wait till you purchase a home and see how easy it is to not have things breakdown. Can you imagine repairing over two hundred apartments at once.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="638683"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="636040" data-beginyear="2004" data-endyear="2007" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20070619"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2004 - 2007 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/19/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;ve been living here for about 3 years.

It&#39;s rare though -- OK&#44; three times in 3 years. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="896630" data-review-id="636040"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="636040"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="612737" data-beginyear="2006" data-endyear="2007" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20070422"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2006 - 2007 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/22/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I enjoyed living at West Village. Living at WV you can enjoy some beautiful&#44; historic architecture&#44; a living environment with a strong sense of community&#44; and close proximity to the local Durham cultural and pub scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The apartments and the complex are all kept in excellent condition. Their maintenance team is very thorough and responsive: If you need a light bulb changed&#44; you only need to call the office and within hours it is changed&#44; and the maintenance person always leaves a note letting you know he was there. The management team&#44; as well&#44; is very responsive and professional. Sabrina has her hands full managing the team and the more than 200 apartments&#44; but she does so with polite and patient professionalism. The other members of her team are exceptional&#44; as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WV is very pet friendly. The management will from time to time leave out pet treats for the entire community to enjoy. There is free Wi-Fi&#44; free cappucino&#44; hot chocolate&#44; and coffee; a comfortable recreation room with games and a community book exchange; a 24 hour good-sized fitness complex; and it seemd to me that most everyone living at WV took it upon themselves to be neighborly - not distant or cold. I really felt that I was part of a community there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As in any city&#44; sometimes finding a close parking place is not possible&#44; but WV management has secured several satellite lots and so one is never sans a space...not ever. These satellite lots are across the street from the complex - thus&#44; not at all far....and given that the Durham police have a substation at WV and park their own vehicles in the satellite lots it is fairly secure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding noise: I did not have much of a problem with noise at the complex&#44; however&#44; it is an issue at times. In those instances the management is very responsive in quelling the offenders and restoring peace. Within my own apartment I could hear the classic rock that my downstair&#39;s neighbor played some nights coming up through one of the large&#44; defunct industrial pipes&#44; but given that I sometimes liked to rock-out myself&#44; fair is fair. I have little doubt that if I had asked my this neighbor to keep it down&#44; he would have done so ---- since everyone really seems to care about each other at WV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think West Village is well worth the rent and one of the very best places to live in the triangle area. It is a place for urban adults who know how to be good neighbors. It is not the place for people who live in fear of Durham&#44; or the city&#44; or who can&#39;t handle putting up with some ambient noise here and there so that one can live in a beautiful&#44; historic building.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards&#44; Martini&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I enjoyed living at West Village.

After reading some of the other reviews on this site, I wonder if it&#39;s West Village&#39;s drug-free policy that really bothered them, since they&#39;re obviously on something to have that kind of attitude. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="188547" data-review-id="259572"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="259572"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="240004" data-beginyear="2001" data-endyear="2002" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20040630"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2001 - 2002 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/30/2004</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I wish I had known of this website earlier, like before I moved in.

Thats what makes them charming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="28294" data-review-id="39120"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919682369027701" data-review-id="39120"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="39125" data-beginyear="2001" data-endyear="2002" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20020809"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2001 - 2002 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 08/09/2002</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Personally, I like it here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have made several new friends in the complex.
