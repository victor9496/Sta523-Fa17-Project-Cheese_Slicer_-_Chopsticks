Overall, I think this is a pretty good place to live. The community is diverse and overall pretty nice. there's a great mix of people in this complex and I really love that. 1. Management has been pretty good. My biggest complaint is that I had to wait to move in (2-3 hours), and then had to ask for the included microwave to be installed when they said they'd install it while I was waiting to move in. They were great about it and set me up the day I came in to remind them. Just wish I didn't have to remind is all. Second biggest complaint is that they do seem to fail to make changes as discussed with them. For example, I asked to extend my lease, but it wasn't changed despite an email confirmation that said they would. Again, was fixed, but frustrating to know that they aren't taking care of what they need to sometimes. A plus: They aren't pushy. They allow me to keep my solitude without flooding my inbox. 2. Maintenance guys are great, but had an incident where the guy caused a bigger leak from a toilet problem. That said, they came in to fix it, so all was well. 3. Their amenities are nice, but I saw a lack of care for some things. For example, the dog waste bag stations took FOREVER to be filled. It took literally 2 months at one point. They seem to be staying on top of it now though, which is great! I really do wish they'd take better care of the pools. A lot of dead bugs and leaves floating in there. Would also be awesome if maintenance could come through and wash the cobwebs off the stairs and outside corners. 4. Noise is ok. I lived on a 2nd floor and had no issues with my neighbors upstairs. My neighbor downstairs can hear my dog prance around though, so it's not the best place for a bigger dog unless you're on the first floor. Lots of neighbors enjoy their balconies and play music sometimes, but its never so loud that I've been bothered. 5. I felt very safe here. The only crime reported during my stay were a couple of break ins into cars that were already unlocked. The alarm system is extremely comforting! Overall, I'd definitely suggest this place to friends. I think it is a safe and wonderful place with a little bit of character. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I lived at Alden place for 7 months.

My roommates and I had issues with them from the time we moved in to the time we moved out. The staff is incredibly rude, unorganized and unfriendly. They tried to charge double rent for the first month because they didn't document that we already paid first months rent. They literally tried to charge us and short hand us with EVERYTHING. This is the 5th apartment complex I've lived in and I've never had issues like this before. They will do just about anything to ensure you pay for something that was their fault. If you want to be overcharged and end up paying a ridiculous amount of money outside of paying rent due to their mistakes, then live at Alden place. I took a picture of my keys, pool pass and mailbox key before I handed it to them because I was afraid they would contact me and try to charge me for not handing them in so I made sure I had proof. This place is awful! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Alden place is HORRIBLE. My roommates and I had issues with them from the time we moved in to the time we moved out. The staff is incredibly rude, unorganized and unfriendly. They tried to charge double rent for the first month because they didn't document that we already paid first months rent. They literally tried to charge us and short hand us with EVERYTHING. This is the 5th apartment complex I've lived in and I've never had issues like this before. They will do just about anything to ensure you pay for something that was their fault.

It was a bit stressful to deal with all of the issues whilst moving in. BUT, once I complained and expressed my unhappiness, every single issue was fixed within 24 hours and done so efficiently. The maintenence staff knows exactly what they are doing (I cannot fully express how well they do their job)-- so if you are planning to move in make sure you have them on speed dial.

The apartments are nice and the grounds are kept beautifully. Unfortunately, the service from management/the leasing office is quite less than stellar in my experience. I've had poor interactions with the leasing office since I moved in, but decided to wait to write a review so I could have a whole year's worth of experience - I didn't want to write a poor review because of isolated incidents. After a year, however, it's been consistent: the service isn't great. Some in the front office are often rude and it seems management is often inconsiderate of the residents. Giving three stars overall, almost 4. I'd still recommend living here, as overall it's a good place, I think. I do not regret choosing this apartment to live in. If anything changes, I'll update this review. Some specific comments on star ratings for the specific categories: Noise: The apartments are right beside 15/501 and the road noise can sometimes be loud. I live on the very north end of the apartments, though, and I imagine it's much better to the south. I, unfortunately, have pretty noisy new neighbors above me, but the community is quiet overall. Grounds: Kept up very beautifully. Kudos to the landscapers. Safety: We get notified of break-ins a few times a year, encouraging us to lock our doors and set or alarms (each unit has an alarm). I do not feel unsafe, and setting the alarm and having renter's insurance seems a reasonable precaution. Neighborhood: The surrounding communities south of 15/501 are kind-of dingy - not pretty or kept up well. Otherwise I love the location. Target is close, shopping center near I-40, and easy access to I-40, Downtown Durham, and Chapel Hill. Maintenance: Maintenance had always been immediately responsive to work orders, and my interactions with maintenance staff have been positive. I have had one poor experience with a maintenance issue, but that poor experience was with management's handling, not maintenance directly. There are some minor maintenance issues with my apartment that I think have mostly to do with the age of the property; nothing serious, though. Staff (leasing office): In my experience, only Lourdes from the front office has been consistently courteous and helpful. She handled my lease when I first moved it and she knows my name when I go to the office. My experience with others at the leasing office have been hit-and-miss - probably 50-50. I don't really like going to the leasing office for this reason. I don't know that I've met everyone working at the leasing office now, so sorry to generalize. One more comment: Alden Place requires renter's insurance and &quot;partners&quot; with a particular insurance provider to provide insurance to their residents. By shopping around, I was able to purchase much cheaper insurance and with higher liability coverage than from their &quot;preferred provider.&quot; I recommend shopping around; remember you'll usually get multi-policy discounts with your auto insurance provider. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We've lived here for over a year. The apartments are nice and the grounds are kept beautifully. Unfortunately, the service from management/the leasing office is quite less than stellar in my experience. I've had poor interactions with the leasing office since I moved in, but decided to wait to write a review so I could have a whole year's worth of experience - I didn't want to write a poor review because of isolated incidents. After a year, however, it's been consistent: the service isn't great. Some in the front office are often rude and it seems management is often inconsiderate of the residents. Giving three stars overall, almost 4. I'd still recommend living here, as overall it's a good place, I think. I do not regret choosing this apartment to live in. If anything changes, I'll update this review. Some specific comments on star ratings for the specific categories: Noise: The apartments are right beside 15/501 and the road noise can sometimes be loud. I live on the very north end of the apartments, though, and I imagine it's much better to the south. I, unfortunately, have pretty noisy new neighbors above me, but the community is quiet overall.

I too also wish that the newer staff members could be as personable as that! And I know what you're saying about the new manager being unapproachable. I mean why can't she be more like Lourdes and scream threats at people throughout the community? Because that's what I call approachable, am I right? No one wants a sweet, docile property manager who keeps her cool. Also, the fact that this was posted three days after the disgruntled assistant manager (Lourdes) got fired isn't suspicious or obvious AT ALL!! No, this review definitely wasn't written by the jobless former employee or one her friends. Because if it was, it wouldn't have been as coy and inconspicuous as this review.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="111779819"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111779543" data-beginyear="2015" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="2" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20160422"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2015 - 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/22/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> My roommate and I are relatively new to the area.

We don't get the same &quot;homey&quot; feeling we did when we first moved in and dread having to go to the office for anything whether it is to put in a work order or simply retrieve a package. The new manager is unapproachable, not personable, and very unprofessional; the whole atmosphere is just tense.

ANOTHER long, terrible review that talks about how the staff used to be great but isn't anymore? On the same day as another review just like it was posted?? Which also just HAPPENS to be a short three days after the assistant manager was fired?? WHAT ARE THE CHANCES? This is definitely believable. I mean the fact that the same exact vocabulary words and adjectives to call out the property manager who had just fired the assistant manager was used in both of these reviews helps to prove the overall believability. If these reviews were fake, they would use different verbage/synonyms and list different issues instead of the same exact ones mentioned in previous review on the same day and it would be a dead give away. But nope, the fact that they are so similar and posted so closely together is definitely NOT a red flag!</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="111779543"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111752955" data-beginyear="2016" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="1" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20160308"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/08/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I relocated my daughter to this apartment complex, which she selected from pictures.

The apartment was pretty much spotless clean, the grounds are beautiful, the location is awesome (every store imaginable is close).

The apartment was pretty much spotless clean, the grounds are beautiful, the location is awesome (every store imaginable is close). These apartments are very well maintained and they have a sincere staff that I believe truly care. I highly recommend Alden Place as a place I would reside. Thank you to Carolyn & Jay at Alden Place!! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3474214" data-review-id="111752955"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="233778"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">03/21/2016</span></div><p>We greatly appreciate your feedback!

We looked in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, but finally decided to settled in Durham due to the affordability and welcoming environment that Alden Place provided. After looking at over five complexes, our leasing manager at AP was extremely courteous and professional with our transactions. We felt very comfortable and she was very friendly and genuine with us. She processed our applications immediately and stayed late on a FRIDAY because she knew that we loved the place and needed a place to live. Super kudos to her and the rest of the staff, because they really make this place special. I now know all of the leasing manager by name. And it definitely says something about a place where the staff know the residents and their kids by name. They really take care in their work and truly want you to live headache-free. In terms of the apartment itself, we were surprised by how modern it looked. 9ft ceilings, screened-in porch, as well as a breakfast bar! Our pantry is huge and our walk-in closets are huge. In terms of the area, it is a few miles (or less) of all the necessities. (i.e. dry cleaning, groceries, Target, etc.). It is right off the 15/501 and close to I-40. There is also a city bus line that runs on the edge of the property that take you to places like Duke and UNC if needed. Ample parking and the club house is nice. Weight room is a bit small for the size of the complex. And my ONLY other criticism is that there isn't sidewalk on the whole property and leading out of the complex. There is also not a traffic / pedestrian light on the University Dr. side which is dangerous for walkers/runners. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Alden Place was a Godsend after a long month of apartment hunting, good and bad.

A while ago, I spoke with her on the phone regarding some maintenance issues I had and she was extremely dismissive. She told me I should of gone online to place a maintenance order but that she would have maintenance handle it. She then dismissed me like I was some sort of a peasant. Mind you, nothing got fixed for over a month! I had to physically go into the leasing office and speak to one of the leasing agents (who was very kind and pleasant) in order to have maintenance come to my apartment. All of the employees at this complex are very nice except the manager and a new employee who acts like he can not be bothered by anyone. Overall, Alden Place is a nice place to live but I have never dealt with such unwelcoming. Also, just an FYI: do not be fooled by all the good reviews on this website. The apartment complex has contests where the offer prizes for posting good reviews on this website. The last prize that was given was an IPad.

So make sure you check out yelp and google for more accurate reviews. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3289768" data-review-id="111499698"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="144350"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">02/06/2015</span></div><p>Thank you for your feedback regarding your living experience and giving us the opportunity to improve our servcie based on your comments.

I moved to NC from PA last October. I looked at probably 20 apartments between Raleigh and Durham, and immediately felt at home when I drove into this development. The grounds are so pretty and well kempt, and the size of the development is perfect. At the time I wasn't paying much attention to how perfect the location was (with Harris Teeter less than a half mile away, Super Target right down the road, and Kroger and Wal Mart within a few minute drive) but after moving in quickly realized how great the location is, with everything you need within minutes. I work at Duke Hospital and can be to work within 10 minutes. The office staff is great! The first person I met was LaShawn, and she has become a friend to me since that day. She is so pleasant and great to deal with, and was very patient with me as a new renter (never having lived on my own) back in November 2013. Every time I go in the office they somehow know my name, and greet me. And they are always more than willing to address any problems. I feel very safe living here and have never felt threatened. I am a runner and am out running every day. That was a concern, having heard many bad things about Durham when I first moved to the area. I would highly recommend these apartments to anyone looking in the area! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I tell my co-workers and friends all the time how much I love living at Alden Place!

Staff always nice/helpful, another plus was that our rent wasn't raised this year! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3226379" data-review-id="111417094"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="115390"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">10/08/2014</span></div><p>Thank you!

The staff is friendly and helpful. I love being able to do almost everything online. When I have a maintenance issue, it is addressed the same day almost every time. As far as the apartment goes, I'm in a two bedroom and anytime a friend comes by they always comment on the size of the apartment and how bright it is inside. The windows are large and the open kitchen is really nice when I'm entertaining. It is also very conveniently located to several shopping centers, Duke and UNC campuses and even the airport is only a 15 minute drive away. I rarely see my neighbors, and they don't seem to be a 'neighborly' group, but I think the management company is trying to create ways to improve the community spirit for those that do want that experience. Overall, the people living here are an ecclectic group of mostly professionals or graduate level students, some with small children. It's quiet, well- maintained and safe. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I have been at Alden Place for about 6 months now and I've been very happy with the overall experience.

The grounds are very well maintained and clean, huge balconies, pet friendly, the landscaping is beautiful, it is very safe and quiet. There are a ton of ammenities; two very large pools, built in alarm systems, two fittness centers, a business center and not to mention, valet waiste disposal! Also, the entire staff, including maintenance, is so welcoming and helpful.

I live on the third floor so I pay a bit more for this. The staff are nice and the maintenance fix our issues. I like the outdoor landscaping. I just think though this place might be more expensive compared to other complexes where you can get more. Some constructive criticism though: 1) Maintenance often arrive a lot later than what they stated. While I understand things might come up, either a more accurate estimate, a call informing us they're coming later, or some online tracking system would be very appreciated so that we know when they will arrive. 2) The rent keeps getting higher for things we do not demand for. So apparently there have been a spate of robberies in this apartment complex and the apartment complex made it mandatory for everyone to have alarm systems. Consequently, we are footing the bill to the tune of an extra $20 per month. In addition, they now required we have apartment insurance and that is us footing the bill as well. This doesn't count the fact that I have to pay an extra $30 per month to live on the third floor. And if you have pets, forget about it! That's about 300-400 (can't remember exactly) deposit. 3) Add a squat rack to your workout rooms. For the staff office who may be reading this, you literally have everything you might need with some heavy dumbbells and a squat rack. EVERYTHING. Also kettle bells would be nice too but they're not essential :) </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Overall decent place to live.

I spent Sunday looking around and on Monday I got into the car and started my quest. I looked at all types of apartments. I wanted a 2/2 and not much noise with a good view. By Tuesday morning I had not found anything. I had a few more to look at, I would walk into them and I did not feel anything for them. My last stop of the day before I left for the airport to head home was Alden Place Apartments. I walked into the office and was greeted my LaShawn. What a welcome greeting! I told her what I wanted she took me to see the models and I was pleasant surprise. It had an open feeling and great lighting, lots of room and I felt like I had just walked into my home. So, I rented on the spot. I have been here a year and love my place very much. Great Staff and people around me and lots of fun things to do on the property and in the area. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> When I can up here last October to look for an apartment I did not have much time (two days).

The staff in the rental office has had some change over as well as the overall leasing company within the 2.5 years I've been here. It's all been positive though and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The grounds is very well kept and they have made steps to improve the dog park and grounds in general. Both pools are great and usually not too crowded. It's very convenient right off the highway and I have always felt safe walking around the community at night. There are certain areas that could be better lit but there is plenty of well-lit areas to walk. Overall, great experience at this apartment and the leasing office. My only complaint would be the addition of the security alarm charge this year of $18 a month. I understand others may want this alarm if they live on the first floor for windows, etc. However, on the top floor I did not find it necessary or valuable in my situation and wished it was optional when renewing my lease. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I have really enjoyed renting at Alden.

I am always impressed that they greet me by name - and I am not often in the office - and they always inquire as to how I am, etc. The maintenance staff is wonderful and work hard to get to any maintenance request usually the next day. The area is tidy and the trash valet is pretty awesome as they pick it up 5 days a week from your front door! I also appreciate having an alarm system within my apartment and a panic button next to my bed. (I have never had to use it, but it does provide peace of mind that it is available.) Having a police office liaison on the property is also an added benefit. The amenities are well kept and clean - the pool is clean and all the residents are so friendly when there. It is convenient to have the large grill and seating area for cookouts too! Having TWO workout rooms is wonderful too, as you can always get onto the machine that you want to use. I also recently rented the large theater room for a movie screening and the area has large comfy couches and chairs. We had a wonderful time there. The community is very close to shopping, restaurants, parks, and a movie theater. All can be reached in less than 5 minutes by car and you could even walk to a few if you wanted. In spite of the fact that the area is so close to the overpass, the noise is still quiet. The property is also around 10 minutes to Duke campus and the commute is very easy. I would recommend this property to people for the location, the property staff, the convenient amenities, and comfortable feel of the area. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> The office staff are very kind and attentive.

Maintenance crew keeps the grounds very clean. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3222044" data-review-id="111411218"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="113826"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">10/02/2014</span></div><p>Thank you for your awesome review.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="111411218"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111411217" data-beginyear="2014" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="1" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20140929"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 09/29/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> For the most part I like living here.

Prices are reasonable for the location and apartments, and other than a few minor marks on the carpet, the apartment was in great condition when I arrived. The few issues that have arisen have been taken care of promptly. Office staff is always extremely kind and respectful, no problems there. There are 2 clubhouses, both with a pool and gym and both are kept up regularly. 2 minutes from Target and Harris Teeter, 5 minutes from Kroger and other shopping, 10 minutes from downtown Durham. A few improvements to be made: -As a pet owner, I will say that there are not nearly enough pet bag stations around the community (with some of them not regularly maintained) and the pet park is pretty small, but those things are minor, and the lack of pet rent is certainly a plus. -There are washer/dryer connections in the unit, but when installed, it's not possible to close the laundry room door. My washer and dryer are not oversized. This is probably more architectural and cannot easily be fixed, but it's something to think about if you're bringing your own W/D. -It's pretty easy to hear what's going on in the apartments above and below you. I've had no problems with those adjacent to me, but even laughing is easily heard. Overall, I'm having a fairly positive experience here and would recommend this apartment complex. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I'm a current resident of Alden Place in a 1 BR on the second floor and have a very positive opinion thus far.

DO NOT LIVE IN ALDEN PLACE APARTMENTS! My story is long but I am going to tell it anyway for the sake of people like you who do not deserve to go through what I have been through! This apartment complex looks nice and is spacious and the location is great but this apartment complex is a miserable place to live. The apartments are nice when you look at them but everything breaks&#44; leaks&#44; molds&#44; and doesn t work within weeks of moving in. Maintenance will come to fix it but it will break again with a week or so! That s only the start! I moved into this apartment complex 7 years ago. At first it wasn t so bad but then the management changed&#44; that was the first management change of 3 or 4 I went through I lost count! Things started to go down hill and just kept going!! They want money around every corner and I am telling you they will get it! They charged for me so much and they would tell me one time and if I didn t pay right then they would threaten to send me to collections! At one point in time after being there for 6 years my fianc and I were looking for move to a cheaper apartment&#44; I was in nursing school and we wanted to get married! However we had to move the wedding because the apartments were charging us 1200 a month plus utilities for a two bedroom that had more problems with it then you want to sit and listen to! So we go to talk to the office about moving&#44; being that I had lived there so long and been loyal to them through all their -------- you would think they would help us! NOPE&#44; they promised to give me a great deal and then proceeded to ignore mine and my fianc s emails and never followed through! So we knew at this point that we had to move! We started looking and trying to get out! The whole time they were trying to charge me for things left and right! We gave our notice and went and paid off everything we owed! We thankfully found a home to move into and we left! Even after we left they charged us over 200 dollars for 5 days of a month we didn t even live their&#44; we were out by the first of the month! Not only that but they got their money and still turned me over to collections when for 7 years I paid them everything I owed them and more!!!!!!! I am not some dramatic person who just had a once and a lifetime bad experience&#44; it happened to other people too! People even named their internet service at that apartment ---- Alden Place&#44; so if that doesn t mean something I do not know what does! They latest staff there is by far some the rudest&#44; non-caring&#44; greedy people I have ever met! I can not believe the way my fianc and I were treated! They are crooks and I hope to God to hear me when I say for your sake PLEASE do not live there!!! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> A word to the wise&#44; unless you want to lose a lot of money and deal with a lot of emotional abuse I would suggest you listen carefully!

The grounds were always kept up and beautiful; and very safe. I have always lived in luxury appartments in Pittsburgh, Dallas, DC -- and I consider Alexan to be #1. If I were living in Durham, I would be living there happily.

You probably won&#39;t get robbed. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2941731" data-review-id="1651412"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="1651412"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1628549" data-beginyear="2013" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20130403"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/03/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> My lease is almost up and I have wanted to move since the day that it started.

We caught about 5 and we didn&#39;t see anymore for a few months. When we came back from vacation&#44; the mice had a party in our apartment. We caught about 12 within a week! All the front office did was send the &#34;bug&#34; guy out who then set-up a bait-trap outside. All that did was to cause a mouse to die in the walls&#44; so we had to live the the stench of it!!!.

I should have known from the very beginning that I should have stayed away from this apartment complex. When we went to visit the place initially&#44; the lady who showed us around seemed as if were greatly inconveniencing her. To make matters worse&#44; when we went to pick up our keys and move in&#44; we were given the wrong apartment. We informed the manager that we had initially agreed on a different apartment&#44; but she basically blamed us for not having our facts straight. Unfortunately&#44; we did not foresee this happening and we did not bring the necessary documents proving our case. Oh well. Life goes on... we thought. After living there for a few months&#44; like others have already stated in their reviews&#44; we&#44; too&#44; had problems with our celing leaking from the upstairs floor. The real kicker is that when our lease was coming up to an end&#44; we had accidentally double paid for our last month&#39;s rent (our rent was automatically being deducted from our checking account&#44; but due to some confusion&#44; we also paid in person). When the mistake was realized&#44; we asked to be refunded for the extra amount paid and were told that they&#39;d settle it when we get our deposit back. We left that apt in a better condition than we moved in (e.g. there were mouse dropping when we moved in; when we moved out&#44; we made sure the mouse droppings were cleaned up)&#44; but SURPRISINGLY&#44; we got none of our deposit back. In fact&#44; they charged us for random fees that resulted in us not even getting the extra money we paid during our last month there. When asked about that&#44; we were told that the electricity to the ENTIRE building got disconnected (and they blamed us for doing it) and that Duke Energy charged them some ridiculous amount to get it reconnected. Interestingly&#44; when we called Duke Energy about it&#44; they said that they never did such a thing. Been e-mailing them regarding this for about the last 2 months... and they&#39;ve yet to respond to my satisfaction. Outwardly&#44; the place looks nice. However&#44; taking into consideration the POOR management/leasing people&#44; it really isn&#39;t worth the money. There are so many other nicer places around. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We lived here for the past 1 year and finally get to leave this horrible place.

I will address a few issues in some of the other reviews 1) Bugs - We have had virtually no bugs the entire time here. This may be because we have a 3rd floor apt away from the forested areas on the edge of the property but its been good otherwise. 2) Noise - Again maybe because of the top floor&#44; but rarely hear anything out of the neighbors. 3) Safety - I have lived other places in Durham where I didn&#39;t feel safe but I definitely feel comfortable walking to my car late at night here. Lights are always on and parking is ample. I do know there have been several break ins over the time here but I know that because we always get a notice from the management that they are aware of the problem and informing us. Granted I wish it didn&#39;t happen but at least they tell us. 4) Management - Ok. I haven&#39;t interacted with them much besides renegotiating our lease each year so I don&#39;t have a lot on this one except they&#39;re nice when I get packages or go in to grab a coffee from the office. 5) Maintenance - This is one part I will definitely argue with. The maintenance staff is extremely nice and willing to help. Since the property is managed by some big parent company you have a 24 hour hotline that you call (in texas somewhere I think) and they take care of the order and I&#39;m guessing have a set of things in the computer at the main office next day. Since the front office doesn&#39;t handle these calls directly maybe thats why a few complained they didn&#39;t know what to do with regards to maintenance. We have always had things fixed almost always the next day. Once our A/C compressor on our main unit outside broke and they were having a new one rushed 2 day over the weekend. This was in the spring and it wasn&#39;t boiling but still warm out and they brought up and setup a portable unit to keep us comfortable while they were getting a part in. Overall unless you are looking at crazy expensive places in Durham its one of the nicer places I&#39;ve found. Also I will add the disclaimer I think the apartments on the North side of the complex are newer than the south side of the street&#44; but the ones I&#39;ve seen on both sides are pretty nice. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I have lived at Alexan for what is going to be 4 years this summer and have enjoyed my time here.

But I must say- I lived here last year and it seems as though you are speaking of a completely different place! Perhaps the amount of insects depends on if you live in an apartment facing the woods. As for the carpet, mine was brand-new and it is said that they change them every lease period. On another note- The fact that you needed to name the race of the manager with &quot;attitude&quot;, really ditracts from how reliable your review could be.... as it is a rather distastful remark.

I signed a lease at Alexan December 2009. My 2-year-old daughter and I have lived here for 12 months and loved every moment of it. Take a look: -The grounds are very well kept and beautiful throughout the seasons. -The pools are clean&#44; and the fitness centers are 24 hrs. -The maintenance staff is prompt very professional and sweet. *I left my car unlocked one night and my radio was stolen. I have heard of other cars being broken into. What you need to be aware of is that this occurs all over Durham. Durham&#39;s car theft and break-in #&#39;s are competitive with larger upstate cities. My point is simply that this is not something that can be controlled by any complex&#44; people are people and they will do as they wish whether the rent at your given apartment complex is $400 or $800 dollars. For god sakes&#44; lock your cars and take valuable items into a locked apartment...SHEESH! -Most residents look like they are foreign grad. students or Duke/UNC/NCCU employees and families so everyone is about their business hence- quiet&#44; professional&#44; friendly. So Im not trying to kiss Alexan&#39;s hoo ha&#44; but I just really loved it. I had to move out because I am relocating to finishing my MSW-GO ME!.

Clearly, Al hasn't looked me up, because then he would have seen that I wrote a genuinely positive review (4/10/2010). We've just moved out of Alexan to move to back to California, but our experience with Alexan has been very good for the two years that we lived there. For people who consider Alexan: there is a market rate for all apartments, and a discounted rate. You get the discounted rate for a 6-12 month lease, or if you renew for a minimum of 3 months (at least, that was the case for us). There is a 2-month notice period. If you go month-to-month you pay the market rate plus $100 per month, but you have a 30-day notice period. We took advantage of that for the last 2 months we lived at Alexan. Our new place in California has an almost identical system, so I guess it's pretty common. I'm not sure about your deposit, but we never paid a deposit, maybe because we had a 'special'. The leasing options have been explained very clearly by the people in the leasing office. Maybe we had good luck, I'm not sure. If you're considering Alexan, I would recommend to ask questions until you fully understand the options for the lease, and don't sign anything without reading it. The place itself it pretty nice compared to other apartment complexes in Durham.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="455163"><div class="responseTitle"> al_dhalla <span class="reviewDate">05/11/2010</span></div><p>Right. You just happen to be a resident who continues to monitor these reviews and know all of the details about the leasing process? Not suspicious at all. Just pathetic. FWIW, the idiots that drafted the Alexan contract say nothing about the discounted rate ever actually expiring, at least not in my contract. They were too stupid to even run their scam correctly. But like I said, who has the time.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="1076672"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1075346" data-beginyear="2010" data-endyear="2010" data-responses="2" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20100507"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2010 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/07/2010</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I recently moved into Alexan Place because I am a student at Duke and most of my friends live here.

I got a mailing from Alexan yet again stating the wrong lease end date, so I went back to their office. The lady there was very nice. She said she understood why I was frustrated and would talk to her boss on Monday. So they might acknowledge their mistake and make amends after all. Either way, I'll update again after I hear from them. If they do fix it, I'll rate them higher, since this lease date issue was by far my biggest problem with this place.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="1071885"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1062245" data-beginyear="2008" data-endyear="2010" data-responses="2" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20100410"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2008 - 2010 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/10/2010</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> After living at 2 other places in Durham&#44; we are now living at Alexan Place for over 2 years. In our opinion this is one of the best places to live in Durham. It&#39;s safe&#44; conveniently located&#44; comfortable&#44; dog-friendly and there is good management. Location & Safety - Alexan place is near everything: shopping&#44; restaurants&#44; Duke (8 minutes)&#44; close to the I-40 and not far from Chapel Hill. Durham definitely has some bad spots&#44; but if you want to be close to Duke&#44; this is the safest place you can be. There are many police officers living at the complex&#44; and we&#39;ve always felt safe. Just some examples of nearby shops: Harris Teeter&#44; Kroger&#44; Target&#44; Sam&#39;s Club&#44; Walmart&#44; Home Depot&#44; Lowe&#39;s&#44; Office Depot&#44; Staples&#44; Best Buy&#44; Bed Bath & Beyond&#44; Petsmart&#44; Petco and many more. The residents - Many Alexan Place residents have some connection to Duke&#44; ranging from employees to PhD and grad students&#44; doctors and nurses. These are mainly busy and quiet people&#44; so it&#39;s not an undergrad party place. People also usually greet each other at the complex. The apartment - We live in a large 2-bedroom in the 600 block. The living room has a lot of natural light&#44; with a sliding door towards the deck with a storage closet. It has a modern kitchen and pantry with space for a washer/dryer&#44; 2 bedrooms with walk-in closets and 2 large bathrooms. They&#39;ve given attention to detail: there are power&#44; phone and cable sockets in every corner. I think they fix up all apartments before people move in: ours looked like new. The one minus is that the HVAC system is somewhat noisy. Dogs - We love the fully-enclosed dog park. I think this is the only complex in the Triangle with its own dog park. We have two small dogs and they love to go there to run and play with other dogs. At several places in the complex there are dispensers with poo bags&#44; so you don&#39;t have to buy your own. When the weather is nice we use the car wash to wash the dogs. Alexan Place charges a non-refundable dog fee for each dog&#44; but in our opinion that&#39;s worth it. Facilities - There are lots of facilities: two swimming pools&#44; one of which is good for lapping (my wife taught me to swim properly there); two gyms that are usually not too crowded; free Starbucks coffee and popcorn in the office; a laundry with brand-new washers and dryers; a car wash; a playground; a business center with free Wifi; and optional daily garbage pick-up at your apartment. Management - The management is very professional&#44; and the ladies in the office are always friendly and very helpful. Many of the staff have been there since we moved in&#44; which is nice. They can also receive packages&#44; which is very convenient. Maintenance - our previous landlord was pretty good: he always fixed things&#44; but it could take a couple of days. At Alexan they fix things the same or the next day: wow! Even when our ceiling came down because of a leak it was fixed in a couple of days. The technicians are friendly and professional. Sometimes they even sing a capella in their lunch break&#44; and they&#39;re pretty good at it :-) So all in all we&#39;re very happy to live here. We&#39;re city people&#44; so Durham is a little too suburban for us. But if you want to live near Duke&#44; this is a very nice place to be.

The Evanosky Foundation supports pediatric leukodystrophy research&#44; universal newborn screening&#44; and assists children and families affected by a leukodystrophy&#44; lysosomal storage disorders&#44; or other disabling pediatric conditions. Since our conception in 2005&#44; we have worked closely with the Duke Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant program both in supporting the program in funding research and also helping care for families that have their son or daughter treated as a result of a terminal condition. As of last year&#44; our foundation launched an initiative called the House of Hope program. The purpose of the program is to provide quality&#44; suitable housing for children and their families that must remain near Duke for up to one year post transplant. We provide housing to the family at no charge to them personally. Even though we are a Chicago based 501(c)(3) corporation&#44; we spent a tremendous amount of time here in Durham determining what apartment complex we would use to base our House of Hope program. Many factors were used in making the determination including but not limited to the overall aesthetics of the grounds&#44; parking&#44; interviewing both office and maintenance staff&#44; willingness of the corporation that owns the complex to allow us to modify the interior to make it suitable for an immune compromised child (we needed to remove the carpet and replace with hardwood) and review of crime statistics in the area of the complexes being considered. In addition&#44; my staff even went to a various apartments of the various complexes and interviewed residents about their experiences at the complexes we were considering. After compiling the data from the various fields&#44; it was determined we would make Alexan Place at South Square the home for our House of Hope Program. The program has been in operation for a little over one year now and we are pleased with how all is proceeding. At present&#44; we have 5 Houses of Hope at Alexan Place and we will add one additional per quarter. The completion of the program will be 15 units all at Alexan Place. One of the monthly duties my staff performs on behalf of the House of Hope program is to monitor the various grip sites that are suppose to help potential renters determine where they should rent. My foundation monitors these sites to aid us in staying informed about the happenings at Alexan Place. Coincidentally&#44; I am a current resident here at Alexan Place since May of this year as a result of having two sons being transplanted presently at Duke; my third was transplanted at Duke in 2005. Since May&#44; some of the Houses of Hope have had to have standard maintenance performed on them. I simply called the toll free maintenance number and a maintenance ticket was created and the work was performed within 24 hours as stipulated by the guarantee Riverstone provides all residents. Also&#44; none of our families have ever complained of parking&#44; but if one expects to park right outside their unit later in the day during the workweek&#44; this may be a challenge. The farthest I have had to park from my unit is across the street. In addition&#44; I have not seen any loose garbage on the property except for the garbage near the dumpster in the evenings after maintenance has gone home. The following day the garbage is gone and the dumpster area is clean. If&#44; for whatever reason&#44; I find that the wind has brought litter to my doorstep&#44; I pick it up and dispose of it just like I do back at my home in Chicago. What I have observed recently regarding the pools is that a number of sororities and fraternities have hosted mixers most likely for the returning and new students coming to school; it brings back memories of my college years. I have observed children here at the complex but I would classify Alexan Place as more of a complex that serves the graduate student or young professional. Finally&#44; I am personally aware of six law enforcement officers that live on the property; there may be more but I cannot validate that. As an individual reading this that may be in the market for an apartment I recommend that you do your own due diligence and investigate not only Alexan Place but the surrounding apartments; there are a few.

Even though my window was completely smashed in&#44; and it was EXTREMEMLY OBVIOUS from the outside that something was wrong&#44; nobody did anything.

They give you the apartment number up-front. In fact, when we lived there, we just said that we did not want a first floor. They gave us all available options for the floor plan we picked. We chose a 2nd floor to avoid the walk, but there were 3 to choose from and we looked in advance to see their location. 2. Why not just throw away the rotting towel instead of letting it sit for a year? As a law student, that's a weak argument point over something that could simply be handled by not being lazy. I'm not saying management has no problems or trying to argue against all the negative posts. At least leave the ranting to your relevant points instead of posting your own errors or lack of effort.

It is written in plain ENGLISH, if you do not understand the terms don't sign it. If you do not agree Don't live in a Apartment Community. You complete the terms of what you agreed then all is FINE, it is when YOU the renter decided to change the terms to fit your needs and wants you decide to slander the choice YOU made, Please place the blame where it belongs on YOUR SHOULDERS. You realize there are laws governing terms and contracts? From buying a car to a contract for a cell phone, this can not be news to you. What do you expect from a business? Fair and proper practices according to the legal contract YOU signed and agreed too. Amazing you can post bitter and hateful posting but you can't accept responsability.

The negative experiences are pretty easy to believe. Don't take my word for it, I'm not trying to sell you anything. When you visit, take a look at the lease they want you to sign. Is that the kind of legal document that welcomes you into a new community? There's a penalty if you die during your lease! Doesn't apartment management know what's happened every time someone's tried to enforce an early termination penalty due on the death of the tenant? That apartment complex shows up on TV. Journalists LOVE a story like that. Grieving parents, crying on TV, talking about how they got a nasty letter from management saying their poor son who just died owes them a couple of thousand dollars. And hey, it's legal, I'm not complaining. But if you're thinking of living here, take a hard look at that lease and ask yourself if you believe the people who keep posting about how everything is great if you do exactly as management says, and that all complaints are just part of apartment living. Or if you believe the people who say that management will squeeze you for every dollar they can. Just look at the lease they want you to sign.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="918259"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="916936" data-beginyear="2006" data-endyear="2009" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20090430"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2006 - 2009 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/30/2009</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;ve been here for three years now and absolutely love it. I&#39;m picky about living in a clean and well-maintained place&#44; and Alexan has always met my needs. Specifically: -I&#39;ve always been able to park right in front of my building&#44; no matter the hours. -I can hear my neighbors running around upstairs a bit&#44; but only a little. Or sometimes our neighbors to the side decide to blast their music&#44; but honestly so do I and I figure it&#39;s a --- for tat and that&#39;s what you get for living in an apartment rather than a house. -The grounds are gorgeous&#44; and if anything are too well maintained. My only complaint about this place is that they mow the lawn at least once a week and it always seems to start at 7:30am right outside my window. Since I&#39;m still in school&#44; 7:30am is not a time I ever plan on being awake. -I have always felt completely safe. I&#39;ve even chatted with the nightly security guards as I walked the short distance from my car to my apartment. I&#39;ve only had two packages left on my porch rather than delivered to the leasing office&#44; but neither were stolen. -The construction is pretty good for the price you pay. No stainless steel appliances&#44; but it is more than sufficient for my picky needs. The only thing we&#39;ve ever really had problems with in the three years is the dishwasher is not exactly the best&#44; but it does it&#39;s job. I love the layout and design of the place&#44; and really loved that they let us paint a few walls to make it our own. -Maintenance has always been great. They have always responded within the same day&#44; and once come at 11pm at night when we had a leak in the bathroom. The only complaint I have ever had about them is when some mold sprang up where the leak had been&#44; they just painted over it rather than trying to treat it. -I&#39;ve always found the staff to be very helpful. I haven&#39;t really had any outlandish requests&#44; so I can&#39;t really say that I&#39;ve seen them go above and beyond. But they have been great in helping me with mail&#44; rent&#44; and lease renewal. No complaints. Overall&#44; this is just a great place to live. The location can&#39;t be beat. It&#39;s so close to the Harris Teeter/Target/some yummy restaurants. I also love that it is right in between Duke&#39;s campus and I40 and closer to Chapel Hill so it always made getting around easier. I&#39;m only sorry that I have to graduate and leave. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I&#39;ve been here for three years now and absolutely love it.

That impression lasted until the middle of August&#44; when everything went to hell. I guess the complex was largely uninhabited in the summer&#44; but once classes started everything went to hell. Parking became a nightmare - if you get back anytime after 10pm&#44; expect to walk the equivalent of a city block to get to your apartment. The noise became unbearable. We were lead to believe that the residents were predominantly Duke graduate students&#44; post docs and young professionals&#44; but I&#39;ve never known that demographic to party this much. The once beautiful grounds were completely trashed. Cigarette butts&#44; animal droppings and garbage are often strewn across the complex. The complex looks safe enough&#44; but looks can be deceiving. There have been a few break-ins since we lived here&#44; but of course the management does its best to keep those under wraps. We only found out because we know the people who were robbed. We&#39;ve also had a couple packages left at our door get stolen (couriers have since gotten wise and now deliver packages to the office). Maintenance is well meaning but poorly managed. Our apartment has&#44; on two separate occasions&#44; been entered by maintenance staff without our permission or notification. Both times were supposedly for a termite inspection. None of the amenities worked. The car wash was turned off for the first few months due to the drought&#44; but once the drought was over a supposed &#34;broken pipe&#34; kept the car wash closed. To this day it still doesn&#39;t work. Worst of all&#44; when we tried to move out&#44; we asked management to give us an extra 2 weeks beyond the end of our lease. This request was made two months in advance. They told us it was completely fine and not to worry about it. When the end of the lease came around&#44; management tried to charge us $676.45 for the extra 12 days we were going to stay. That amounts to almost $1800/month&#44; an increase of over 100&#37; of our original rent of $875. Management argued that this was allowed under the terms of our contract. I reviewed the contract and found nothing allowing management to raise the rent without providing 60 days notice. When I asked the property manager to clarify&#44; she refused&#44; and simply stated it was policy. Long story short&#44; please don&#39;t be deceived by the appearance of this complex.

Most likely one of them will be a &#39;business student&#39;. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ll mention the fact that there are two pools&#44; though. I&#39;m not saying all the positive reviews which are written in the same style and show up on the same day and say nothing bad are fake&#44; but honestly&#44; has anybody ever met anybody who was enthusiastic about a monthly newsletter? You know who is enthusiastic about monthly newsletters? The person who&#39;s writing the monthly newsletter. Speaking of which&#44; I haven&#39;t gotten one of those for a while&#44; so if monthly newsletters really are a big draw for you&#44; I have bad news. Here&#39;s the thing about Alexan South Square. There are&#44; indeed&#44; two pools. There is&#44; yes&#44; a dog walking area and a grilling area. Anything that can be touted in a brochure is technically there. It&#39;s the other little things that are missing. There is an utter lack of soundproofing. I&#39;ve seen first day Habitat for Humanity volunteers do a better caulking job on a bathroom. Most of the shelves are made out of cheap particle board. The carpet is bargain basement. So is the kitchen flooring. I can hear it every time my neighbor takes a shower. When those business school students come home at three in the morning and want to shriek drunkenly? You&#39;ll know. Alexan South Square advertises itself as a luxury apartment complex&#44; and if you think luxury is having &#39;stuff&#39; like a grilling area and an exercise room&#44; Alexan South Square has that. After living here for a while&#44; though&#44; I&#39;ve realized that luxury isn&#39;t how many pools you have. Luxury is not being woken up every time somebody goes up the stairs in front of your apartment. Luxury is not being treated ungraciously by management if there is a problem. The ladies at the front office have always been helpful&#44; polite&#44; and kind. The grounds are well kept. The appliances are top of the line. It&#39;s just that there are other apartment complexes in the area which are much cheaper and just as noisy&#44; and which don&#39;t have strange attitudes from upper management. Don&#39;t take my word for it. If you&#39;re interested in this apartment complex&#44; visit an apartment&#44; close the door and have your husband walk up the stairs. See if you can hear him from the bedroom. Have him talk outside the window. Look at the shelving. Then ask yourself what luxury means to you. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> The one thing living at Alexan South Square has given me is the ability to see the future.

There are&#44; indeed&#44; two pools. There is&#44; yes&#44; a dog walking area and a grilling area. Anything that can be touted in a brochure is technically there. It&#39;s the other little things that are missing. There is an utter lack of soundproofing. I&#39;ve seen first day Habitat for Humanity volunteers do a better caulking job on a bathroom. Most of the shelves are made out of cheap particle board. The carpet is bargain basement. So is the kitchen flooring. I can hear it every time my neighbor takes a shower. When those business school students come home at three in the morning and want to shriek drunkenly? You&#39;ll know. Alexan South Square advertises itself as a luxury apartment complex&#44; and if you think luxury is having &#39;stuff&#39; like a grilling area and an exercise room&#44; Alexan South Square has that. After living here for a while&#44; though&#44; I&#39;ve realized that luxury isn&#39;t how many pools you have. Luxury is not being woken up every time somebody goes up the stairs in front of your apartment. Luxury is not being treated ungraciously by management if there is a problem. The ladies at the front office have always been helpful&#44; polite&#44; and kind. The grounds are well kept. The appliances are top of the line. It&#39;s just that there are other apartment complexes in the area which are much cheaper and just as noisy&#44; and which don&#39;t have strange attitudes from upper management. Don&#39;t take my word for it. If you&#39;re interested in this apartment complex&#44; visit an apartment&#44; close the door and have your husband walk up the stairs. See if you can hear him from the bedroom. Have him talk outside the window. Look at the shelving. Then ask yourself what luxury means to you. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1927112" data-review-id="900330"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response " data-response-id="319519"><div class="responseTitle"> Dukechick <span class="reviewDate">03/24/2009</span></div><p>It's funny how you say that when a bad review is posted, good reviews are posted shortly after. I believe that the reason this occurs is because the residents who actually live here CARE about their homes, and don't want some sound-sensitive, complaining person talking trash on where they live. It's apartment living! You can't expect to NOT hear your neighbor! If you do expect that, then get a house!</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="900330"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="898568" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20090319"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 - 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/19/2009</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Best years of my life.

From what I&#39;ve heard&#44; seen and read&#44; it&#39;s a great school located in a beautiful&#44; semi-rural area. The apartment itself is spacious&#44; modern&#44; and clean. The complex looks nice over all. I have dogs so I like the fact that it is a dog-friendly neighborhood with a dog park. The amenities like the business center&#44; pool (with free wi-fi)&#44; gym&#44; Starbucks coffee machine in the office&#44; tanning bed&#44; etc... are all nice. I like most of the people that live here&#44; too. They are almost all very friendly and come from diverse backgrounds. When something needs repair in the apartment&#44; the maintenance staff is courteous&#44; prompt&#44; and helpful. The walls are quite thick and my next door neighbor can&#39;t hear my kids or movies on my surround sound system. I&#39;m not quite sure about the floors or ceiling&#44; though. I can hear the upstairs neighbor walking but he&#39;s a quite guy and never has company or plays music. Those are the pros... For the cons... I would say the biggest drawback is the small percentage of people that move in and don&#39;t take care of their surroundings. Some have dogs and don&#39;t clean up after them even though there are stations with bags and a garbage can for clean-up. Others smoke and throw cigarette butts on the ground. Yet others just throw any trash on the ground. Luckily&#44; this is a small percentage of the tenants. This brings me to my second complaint. I have one neighbor in particular that just moved in and throws cigarettes on the ground. I asked management to please ask her to stop littering. I was told they would put a notice on all the doors in the building. A week passed and nothing... I went back. The second time I had to speak to the manager. She got an attitude with me and told me the printer was broken and that they were going to do it. Another week passed and still no notice. I&#39;ve pretty much just talked myself into dealing with it. If you ever have a complaint&#44; I suggest speaking with one of the younger girls in the office. They are much more approachable. Let them deal with the sassy manager. Overall&#44; I enjoy living here&#44; though. The pros outweigh the cons. I would recommend it&#44; especially to students.

From august to march we had 2 bathrooms but only one toilet we could use due to some leaking. The bathtub caulking was cracked and that was never fixed either. The worst part came when the complex withheld my mail which had time sensitive information which caused my nursing lisence to lapse causing my employment to be suspended without pay!!! I got in touch with management and they werent willing to do anything to rectify the situation. We are currently looking to seek legal action for lost wages. Also&#44; cars are broken into all the time and the apartment complex did nothing to let their tenants know they were in any danger! The most we got was a sugar-coated letter saying to hide valuables&#44; but not that any theft had taken place! The only way I knew is that a resident who works with me and who lived in my building had been one of the unlucky ones robbed. I dont know how legal that is&#44; but it is definately unsafe!!! PLEASE look elsewhere&#44; it isnt worth it to end up like my husband and myself. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I am currently a resident at alexan place and I have had a plethora of problems with the complex since my husband and I moved in.

The worst part came when the complex withheld my mail which had time sensitive information which caused my nursing lisence to lapse causing my employment to be suspended without pay!!! I got in touch with management and they werent willing to do anything to rectify the situation. We are currently looking to seek legal action for lost wages. Also&#44; cars are broken into all the time and the apartment complex did nothing to let their tenants know they were in any danger! The most we got was a sugar-coated letter saying to hide valuables&#44; but not that any theft had taken place! The only way I knew is that a resident who works with me and who lived in my building had been one of the unlucky ones robbed. I dont know how legal that is&#44; but it is definately unsafe!!! PLEASE look elsewhere&#44; it isnt worth it to end up like my husband and myself. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1502947" data-review-id="745220"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>3 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="3"><div class="response " data-response-id="197575"><div class="responseTitle"> jumppete <span class="reviewDate">03/22/2008</span></div><p>This is ridiculous. I've been living here for 2.5 years and I've never had a problem with maintenance. They have always responded to my problems within a day or two, and they are available after hours for emergencies. They're all very friendly and professional, and are flexible about working around my two dogs. As for mail, I have no idea why it would be the leasing office's responsibility to track you down. They do us a service by collecting packages all day while we're at work and school, and I've never had a problem.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="197269"><div class="responseTitle"> takeastand <span class="reviewDate">03/21/2008</span></div><p>I am also a current resident of Alexan Place for over a year and have a hard time believing the above mentioned plethora of problems by these residents. They would have to be the exception rather than the rule. First off I have found tthe management and staff to be nothing but friendly, courteous, and responsive to my needs as a resident, and have seen the atmosphere in the office change even further for the better since the since the first of the year. They appear more outgoing and friendly and treat me as if my issue is the most important thing they have on their plate at the time. Any problem I have had with my apt.,no matter how major or minor, has been corrected in a very quick and courteous way. As for withodin mail, how can that be the responsibility of the office, mail is deliveredby the mail carrier to the mail station and if you have a regustered letter that has been left at the office the mail carrier will leave a notice on your door. It would appear to me that if I had a time-sensitive document that was direrctly related to whether I was employed or not I would have been looking for this letter daily and would have notified the office to keep their eyes out for it in case they left it at the office instead of looking for someone to blame for my own shortcomings. I have had packages and mail delivered to the office and always took it upon myself to stop by and check with the staff to get my packages as they have a huge room full of items and would be virtually impossible to know what was urgent or time-sensitive to me as a resident of over 500 units. As for the legal action I guess you can sue for anything but as a judge I would luv to hear how it could possibly be someone elses fault that you didn't pick up your own mail and where it was sombody elses responsibility to track you down to deliver it. As for the cars being broken into, hello, you live in a place that has a large parking area full of vehicles which is a target rich environment for would-be car thieves. The best way, just like with the mail, is to be responsible for your own actions, remove your valuables from sight, lock them in the trunk or take them inside with you. If you leave things out in the open you are inviting a car thief to take your stuff, don't park in a dark area or near bushes instead of looking for someone else to blame. What difference would it make to me if a few cars had been broken into and I was not notified, but I did get a letter, didn't you, but either way it is my responsibility to protect my belongings not the ladies in the leasing office. Sorry for the rant but I get tired of people who don't take responsibility for their own actions and are always looking for someone else to blame for anything that doesn't go their way. The office and maintenance staff have been nothing but kind, courteous, and professional to me in any interaction I have had with them and as long as I pay my rent n time I'm confident that relationship will continue. Their job is to provide me with living space for as long as I pay rent not to be my parents and make sure I have hid my valuables, locked my doors, or picked up my mail, that is my job as a responsible adult.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="197423"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">03/21/2008</span></div><p>I can also attest to the fact that you are one of those sad people that searches for anyone but yourself to put the blame on. We moved in January and yes there were a couple maintenance issues that needed to be addressed. But guess what, the maintenance staff is not run by the apartment complex staff. It is a seperate company with its own staff. If we felt the people were taking too long to address a problem, we simply called back to report it again and let them know it was important to have the problem resolved quickly. And hey what do ya know?! They came and fixed it, offered their appologies and the manager made sure to call and ask for feedback. It's all about how you treat other people. Maybe you should learn better skills. As for the break-ins I know FIRST HAND that they do not happen &quot;all the time&quot;. In fact the last car break-in occured almost a year ago. I have seen the police reports and the many break-ins that you say happened all occured on one night by the same people. After that night there have been no more reported because they moved on. Yes crime happens everywhere, and Durham does have a reputation, but if you're going to be so naive to think it can't happen to you then you deserve to have your stuff stolen. This complex is very safe and if you ever feel something better can be done, why don't you suggest it POLITELY to the management and they will actually do their best to fix it, rather than be so immature to post a bad review about stuff you barely know anything about.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="745220"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="637410" data-beginyear="2007" data-endyear="2007" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20070621"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2007 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/21/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I had never been happy with an apartment complex I lived in before&#44; but Alexan Place is&#44; overall&#44; a pretty good place to live in. I just graduated from Duke MBA (Fuqua)&#44; and my wife is a rising-third-year (3L) at UNC. We are moving out soon due to our relocation to Texas. Pros 1. Location is great. I have a seven-minute drive to my school&#44; and my wife has a twelve-minute one to hers. 2. Facilites are high-quality. The gyms and the pools are nice. 3. There are a lot of graduate students in this complex. I know that there are at least thirty Duke MBAs (and their families) staying here. 4. Staff is very friendly. The packages not being found used to be a problem last year&#44; but it seems that the packages are stored in a pretty organized manner now. 5. Maintenance crew is good. For example&#44; our A/C was broken (leaking water)&#44; and the repair guys had to make four trips over a couple of days&#44; but they fixed it well at the end. Cons 1. When I was trying to find an apartment in the area. I talked to a couple of apartment complex representatives (this is about two years ago). One of them told me that because of a lawsuit around year 2000&#44; the new complexes do not have jacuzzis (hot tubs). So it is the same for Alexan Place -- no jacuzzi in which you can just drink your beer and relax. 2. Safety is not horrible&#44; but is a concern for all complexes in Durham. This complex is in a nice area of Durham&#44; but still -- stuff happens. My car was broken into last year; the thieves stole the stereo&#44; so not a huge deal&#44; I guess. Tip: Try to sign your lease as early as possible. We signed our lease before Duke&#39;s Blue ----- Weekend (in early April)&#44; and we ended up with a rate lower than what some of friends have had to pay. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I had never been happy with an apartment complex I lived in before&#44; but Alexan Place is&#44; overall&#44; a pretty good place to live in.

In addition to these issues&#44; I personally dealt with management when I sought to extend my lease by a few months while I studied for the bar and was told that doing so would cost me nearly double rent per month. While I understand that the market and new management policies may well have required this&#44; it is the way they treated me - a long time resident who had had no real problems in the past - that still resonates. There may be &#34;two sides&#34; to my story as well&#44; but the fact remains that I was a paying customer&#44; and management is in the customer service business. The woman I dealt with was rude&#44; defensive&#44; and unwilling to compromise. I ultimately moved out&#44; and after all of that&#44; my apartment was vacant over the summer!

I never found the packages&#44; some important bar materials. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t recommend Alexan not because of their lease extension or package retention policies - it&#39;s the unforgiving nature of the staff when you hope for some humanity (how hard is it to search for my name on my bar materials?) that makes the place undesirable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also&#44; I know this isn&#39;t as much a problem anymore&#44; but I had a unit that was close to the construction and for a year was woken up by the early morning drilling - even on weekends.

I hope they&#39;re not graduating with a degree in math... my guess is management. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="554479" data-review-id="572652"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="572652"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="571487" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2007" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20070111"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 - 2007 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 01/11/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I live at this very same community as the past 2 years and have had a pleasant experience.

On the plus side&#44; the layout is good. The apartment is spacious&#44; with ample closet space. The appliances (dishwasher&#44; fridge&#44; stove&#44; tub&#44; etc.) are all high quality (except for the vent hood&#44; which is weak). The patio&#39;s sliding door came with a security bar&#44; which is a thoughtful touch. The clubhouse is excellent&#44; and the fitness room is well equipped with a variety of machines and free-weights. The entire complex looks pretty&#44; and is well maintained. The office staff is friendly&#44; responsive&#44; and has been very helpful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The downside&#44; however&#44; becomes quickly obvious. The complex was simply poorly constructed. The walls are incredibly thin. I know way more about my neighbors than I ever wanted to. The guy upstairs? He wakes up at 6:30. Sometimes he wakes up early and forgets to turn off the alarm&#44; and he thunders across the apartment to turn it off. Sometimes he wants to sleep in&#44; and he hits the snooze alarm three times or so. I can hear all of that. I can hear every step he takes. Sometimes he pees really early in the morning. I worry that he may have some sort of infection or something&#44; since he&#39;s much too young to be doing that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a couple that lives up and to one side of me. They&#39;re a happy couple&#44; and sometimes there&#39;s roughhousing. A lot of times there&#39;s high spirited yelling. I do know for sure that they keep their clothes in drawers&#44; and that someone has a hard time deciding what they want to wear&#44; because those drawers open and shut a LOT. They wake up at 6:00. I can hear all of that too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes the guy who doesn&#39;t wake up until 6:30 gets angry at the couple who wakes up at 6:00&#44; and there&#39;s angry yelling with a lot of naughty words. Then he starts playing music really loud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah&#44; it seems like most of the people who live here are professionals ... but at least students sleep late. Let&#39;s be fair -- I&#39;m sure that my neighbors don&#39;t enjoy listening to me when I have the urge to play bad 80&#39;s music&#44; or when I&#39;m ... being ... intimate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also&#44; a lot of first floor apartments have air conditioning units located directly outside the bedroom. It&#39;s not so much that it&#39;s loud&#44; but they kick in at 3:00 AM&#44; and if you&#39;re a light sleeper ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah&#44; thin walls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was an insect problem&#44; but they sprayed&#44; and it went away. Occasionally I wake up to find that an insect has tried to penetrate the Chemical Barrier and has promptly expired in the foyer-area. Now that is what I am talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like a pretty safe place -- I saw one window smashed out of a car to break in&#44; though&#44; so I&#39;m not sure how safe it is. I just stopped parking near there. I don&#39;t keep expensive stuff in my car anyway. But if you do ... something to watch out for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh&#44; yeah&#44; the carpet. I&#39;m getting the little fuzzies every time I vacuum too. But I&#39;m told that this is the carpet slowly thinning&#44; and that it&#39;s evidence of cheap carpet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the summary is: It&#39;s still a pretty good deal. The apartment is very pretty. It&#39;s spacious for the price. It has its charms. But it&#39;s poorly made. If you have problems with noise&#44; you might want to reconsider&#44; or get a top floor apartment. And I wouldn&#39;t want to make long term plans for any of these apartments. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> This apartment complex is really a mixed bag.

When we first moved in it was filthy - like no one had cleaned since the last people moved out. Not just dust and mold&#44; but unwanted hairs...you get the picture. It took weeks and multiple phone calls to have it cleaned (we happened to be on vacation right after we moved in)&#44; and they still did a bad job.&lt;br&gt;2. Also while we were on said vacation the vacant apartment upstairs flooded into our apartment. They tried to clean it up and not tell us. We confronted the maintenance guy when we discovered all our moving boxes were soaked and he confessed what happened but told us he wasn&#39;t supposed to tell us.&lt;br&gt;3. Our pipes are REALLY loud anytime anyone in the whole buidling uses the hot water. You don&#39;t just hear the water&#44; but this knocking sound that is like dropping marbles on metal. Its wonderful when your neighbor wants to wash his face or a dish at 1am.

When we explained to them it was approved&#44; they said too bad&#44; take it down&#44; we don&#39;t have to honor old agreements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could go on and on and on...thank God we are graduating and moving soon! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="447809" data-review-id="508018"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="508018"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="481520" data-beginyear="2006" data-endyear="2006" data-responses="0" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20060708"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2006 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 07/08/2006</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Generally speaking&#44; this is a nice area to live. Especially with some promotion price at the new apartment areas&#44; which was completed at Nov&#44; 2005. It is really new&#44; the fitness center is really new&#44; the pool is nice&#44; also&#44; the open bbq area with big TV and sofa is really great. I would recommend others to live in this area&#44; but still I did not give a high rating because...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is usually very quite&#44; although one side of the community is facing 15-501&#44; but if you close your windows&#44; you won&#39;t hear much. Also&#44; you won&#39;t hear your neighbours much. But&#44; if you live by the pool&#44; be aware that there might be neighbours&#44; who will swiming and chasing around the pool during the midnight&#44; I mean 1:00am-3:00am. If your bedroom happen to be facing the pool&#44; you will hear some noise... Also&#44; sometimes at night&#44; you can still hear people chatting/playing at the bbq area(which is by the pool)&#44; and they may turn the pool speakers on&#44; which add some more noise. It is nice to have people around and using the pool and bbq areas&#44; but jut NOT MIDNIGHT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly&#44; the leasing office might response you VERY slowly. For example&#44; we requested to ask the mentaince guy to help us install some extra lights&#44; but it took us 4 visits to the leasing office to get it done. Another example is that our alarm system was broken during some thunderstorm while we are away(for a trip). After we came back&#44; we found out that one of the bedroom do not have electricity. If we turn it on&#44; the alarms will be on(with loud sounds). So we went to the leasing office&#44; and request a repair. We visited them almost everyday&#44; until everyone in the office knows our apartment... Finally&#44; after more than 2 weeks without electricity in our bedroom&#44; they fixed it. It took 2 WEEKS!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One more thing&#44; this is a new aparment&#44; and you expect everything is new. Ovens&#44; furniturs&#44; carpet... which is good. But I am not sure whether is the problem with the pool quality carpet in this community&#44; or is the problem with all new carpet&#44; our floor will &#34;grow&#34; some fuzzy white things after a while(say 3 or 4 days) and you need to use vaccum or pick them up frequently. We complained this&#44; but they say it is a typical problem with all new carpet&#44; and the only solution is to use the vaccume more frequently. And we&#39;ve been using our vaccume frequently for about 2 months&#44; still the fuzzy thing continues &#34;growing&#34;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than these&#44; we don&#39;t have much complaint. One minor issue is the parking place is quite narrow. But since there isn&#39;t much people here now(because it is really new)&#44; they is a lot empty parking place&#44; and if you just park one location away from other cars&#44; the space is &#34;a lot&#34;. Anyway&#44; minor issue&#44; you just need to be more careful while parking. About safty issue&#44; I read some negative reviews before I moved in. But so far&#44; I think it is OK&#44; since I did not experiance nor heard about car window break ins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To summarize&#44; it is a nice community with some problems. I love this place&#44; if they can make the service better&#44; and if there is no big noises from the pool area after 24:00. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Generally speaking&#44; this is a nice area to live.

I&#39;ve enjoyed my stay here very much&#44; and would recommend it to others. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="385060" data-review-id="439479"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="439479"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="424605" data-beginyear="2003" data-endyear="2006" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20060316"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2003 - 2006 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/16/2006</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I have lived in the apartment since May 2003 and am quite satisfied.

For all you parents looking for a safe environment for your loved ones as they pursue their dream, this is the place. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="264914" data-review-id="336657"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="336657"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="327030" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2005" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20050511"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/11/2005</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Although I am not a resident as of yet, I move to Alexan South Square in July, I just had to write in to show my gratitude for the kindness, professionalism, and great attitudes I encountered at this community.&lt;br&gt;Moving in from out of state makes apartment searching more difficult.

They made me laugh, feel comfortable, and most importantly part of the community and I hadn&#39;t even applied yet. They treated me like a person, not customer. Out of 6 communities I visited, this was the only one that stood out both in niceness of apartments and in knowing how to treat people. Needless to say, I am moving here in July and can&#39;t wait.

Give me a break! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="129522" data-review-id="196711"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="888212444327707" data-review-id="196711"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="192082" data-beginyear="2003" data-endyear="2004" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20040217"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2003 - 2004 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/17/2004</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I don&#180;t understand the complaints over the ice storm.

Others spoke of break-ins here. I moved here from a ghetto apartment in Carrboro, and can safely say that Alexan Place is very safe and very well-lit in comparison. The office staff is very friendly a well. Rent isn&acute;t so bad - $850/mo. for a 2 bedroom after factoring in the first 2 months free.
