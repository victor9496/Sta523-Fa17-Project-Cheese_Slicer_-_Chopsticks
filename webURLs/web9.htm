Had to move three weeks early and pay rent in two places for three weeks. It was that or stay in my terrible apartment for another 3 weeks and have only one moving day. The apartment appears more spacious and is definitely a better location for me. Management, office people and maintenance are all nice and professional. I had a leak in my first week. It was handled quickly. I love the location and grounds that this apartment is located on. Only complaints. Kinda noisy. The location of my apartment leaves much to be desired (first floor, right next to stairwell). Pool is crazy small. There are a lot of tenants here. Can't imagine anyone has room to actually enjoy the pool when the season comes. And parking. You can almost never get a spot anywhere near your place. At least I can't. And visitor spaces are always full ( I imagine by tenants who don't want to park too far in their own spaces or have too many automobiles, because some cars NEVER leave.) Overall. It's a cute spot. I love my fireplace. The bedrooms and living rooms have a good size. Ample storage(everywhere but the kitchen.) Kitchen and bathrooms are a bit cramped. Especially the bathroom. I hit my head on my towel rack standing up from the toilet. I'm only 5'7 Would I move here again? Yes. Just feel a bit overpriced. But. It was better than my prior experience at my last place. So.

The only reason we are moving is that we have more kids and need a 3 bedroom now. If not for that, we would stay. It's so safe and much quieter than you'd expect, being off the main hwy. So so close to everything! 3 grocery stores within 2 minutes, Southpoint is 5 minutes away, great food and coffee within minutes. We would even take the onsite trail (part of Tobacco Trail) through to the back roads to walk to Southpoint. Lovely onsite trails that take you to a playground and outdoor gym. And the pool is very nice and tree lined. Maintenance is here within 24 hours if we ever have an issue. Will be super sad to leave. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We have loved living in Park Ridge the past few years.

The office staff are always super friendly and maintenance will come within 24 hours of the request. The complex is off of a major road (54), but you don't feel like it since you're backed up from it. There is a water fowl preserve backed up to part of the property and woodcroft is on the other side. We have access to woodcroft's path system and use it regularly. Pets are allowed and noise level hasn't been an issue. There is a laundry room on site, as well as a gym, tennis court, dog park, and pool. Laundry hookups are available in all units, but some of the newer units have a washer and dryer in the unit. Sometimes parking is tricky, but I can always find a spot near my building. The complex always has some kind of event for its residents. The office staff and maintenance is efficient and will email and call you for anything pertaining to your apartment. I love living here and look forward to being here years to come! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I've been living here for over 2 years now and I love it!

The cons of this complex are small in comparison: The dog park is partially dirt leaving you to bathe your dog with each visit, visitor parking is heavily enforced (i.e. towing enforced). I highly recommend this complex to anyone who wants to be comfortable at a reasonable price. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I stumbled upon this apartment complex mistakenly and quickly fell in love with it.

Close to everything, stores, schools and in my case work but hidden away in the woods to make it easy to unwind after work and not hear the noise of the city.

My roommate and I lived at Park Ridge for a year and had an OK time while living there but a horrible time moving out. Our A/C broke mid-July and it took them 3 days to fix it. Meanwhile, it was reaching 90 degrees in our apartment. When we went to move out, the management blamed the &quot;saturated&quot; carpet, which was in the area of the A/C unit, on my roommate's less than 10 lb, house-broken dog. We tried to reason with the management that the wet carpet was due to the A/C overheating but to no avail. The property manager at the time, Rita, went so far as to avoid dealing with us that she once lied and say she was not on the property when I saw her 10 minutes later walking out to her car. She also lied to my face and to my roommate and said that I said the apartment smelled like urine. Because of the carpet fiasco and lack of reasoning by the property management, my roommate and I were stuck with about an $800 bill for carpet we did not mess up. Also, for the last month of rent my card was charged more than the amount of rent we should have paid and this money was not refunded to me but was instead held until the carpet bill was paid. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I would steer clear of signing a lease with Park Ridge!

Any one of my complaints on their own really wouldn&#39;t be a dealbreaker for me- or for most people. But when you add them all together over a year&#44; this place becomes unbearable. Where to start.... When moving in&#44; the former asst manager was less than a delight. Thank goodness she is gone (promoted&#44; by the way). I confirmed in advance that I did not need an appointment to move in&#44; but then she was very taken back by me arriving at the office the morning of my move in date. She said she had not even walked the unit yet and there were no keys made. I had to wait an extra hour with my moving helpers for her to get it all together- no apologizes- she just acted as though I was a huge inconvenience. My biggest issue is NOISE. The breezways are not open on both sides. Therefore&#44; the entrances are concrete caves in which every single sound is amplified. If a neighbor is quietly talking on their phone as they enter their unit&#44; you can hear that anywhere in the apartment. I have been woken several times by drunk neighbors in the middle of the night&#44; laughing and shrieking as they make their way into their units. Also&#44; the mailboxes are on the exterior wall outside of my apartment. The pictures hung on that wall are crooked and one has broken from the carrier and others slammed the mailbox doors too hard. I can literally hear the mail carrier opening/closing the door when I am in the shower- which is on the other side of the apartment. Finally&#44; I am interrupted every time my neighbor uses his patio. The sliding glass door is so loud and stuck that it shakes my ceiling. And he is a smoker&#44; so he is out there about once an hour. My sliding glass door is also nearly impossible to open so I never use the patio. I am on the ground floor&#44; and my view of the parking lot and moss is not that appealing anyways. Speaking of shower- it is GROSS. My bathtub&#44; which is tiny&#44; should have been resealed before move in. The tub is chipped&#44; which causes mold to grow in the shower after about one week. I literally scrub the bathtub three times a week- it still looks disgusting and awful&#44; but there is no mold. I also get very little hot water&#44; but after several maintenance requests to address that&#44; I gave up. I shower quickly because I dont really want to be in there anyways. If you have one of the 650 sp ft units&#44; the closet is absurd. It is a narrow long closet and when it is empty&#44; it is not so bad. But once you put things in there... you can even get to the back. I step in sideways&#44; reach to the back&#44; knocking most things off the hangers. The bedroom is very small so there is not a lot of space for a large dresser instead. The insulation is very poor. For my small apartment&#44; my electric bills were close to $200 a month in the winter. I had a 3 story townhouse before this place and the bills were not even close to that. Except to pay about $40 a month for water and trash. I use about $5 worth of water&#44; but pay the rest in fees. The pool is ok- but by no means can you call it nice. There are usually kids there screaming or crying and their parents do nothing to address the behavior&#44; so it is not peaceful either. The bathrooms are dirty and never have toilet paper so I expect there is a lot of waste that ends up in the pool. Last week there was a bum who appeared to be residing in the dumpster area. A lot of insects get into the place- roaches and spiders mainly. This is NC and I am on the first floor&#44; so I know it happens&#44; but it has happened here much more than other places I have lived. There is no a lot of visitor parking close to all buildings. It looks like some residents have unauthorized people living with them because the visitor spots always have the same few cars in them- all day&#44; every day. The kitchens were recently updated&#44; and they look alright. The lighting fixtures in the kitchen and dining room are modern and nice. the property claimed it had a full renovation&#44; but changing out cabinets and countertops is an update&#44; not a renovation. As part of the &#39;reno&#39; they painted doors and patios. They painted our front doors shut! I had to body slam myself through the door to get in- I actually thought they had changed the locks on me! The insulation around then door was then stuck to paint and as a result&#44; I have to pull my door with all my strength to be able to lock it up when I leave. This complex is very overpriced considering what it offers. There are plenty of other options within just a few miles that are just a tad more expensive&#44; but miles ahead of Park Ridge. The maintenance team is nice&#44; but there is no sense of urgency to complete requests. I am somewhat embarrassed to have company over because the community just looks rundown and poorly kept. I don&#39;t want anyone to have to use my moldy shower&#44; and the amount of noise frightens most guests. Don&#39;t waste your money on this place- you will just have to pay to move again in a year! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I cant wait to move OUT!

I don&#39;t want anyone to have to use my moldy shower&#44; and the amount of noise frightens most guests. Don&#39;t waste your money on this place- you will just have to pay to move again in a year! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2190544" data-review-id="111322590"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="94764"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">06/25/2014</span></div><p>Thank you for taking the time to provide a review.

It seems like they are constantly trying to cut corners in small ways to make money.

It screamed that they can&#39;t keep customers with the positives of the community and instead have better luck convincing people that it is more of an inconvenience to move. Move in was a bit of a hassle. Somehow the unit that they thought was going to be available on the day I wanted to move in was actually just being vacated that day and they needed 2 weeks to get it ready. When I moved it there were several things that were missing or still needed to be done (missing towel rack for the bathroom&#44; missing window screens&#44; ect) so definitely go over the move in check list very well.

Literally took 3 hours to install weather stripping on two doors and within 2 months it started to fall off.

Pests- There was a roach in the hall closet at move in. It disappeared a couple weeks later&#44; but the closet still smells musty. Haven&#39;t seen a roach since. Fleas haven&#39;t been a problem. I do see a spider and a house centipede about once a month. Fruit flies almost consistently during the summer. Overall&#44; it&#39;s about what I would expect for an apartment building in the south.

There is a 2&quot; gap around the dryer hose which I've asked them to tape or fill in several times and nothing's happened. There's also a 2 foot bubble in the paint in the bathroom that keeps growing. Asked them to look at that too and they said it was nothing. So shoddy paint job, mold, or water damage. I have seen roaches in the stairwell on occasion, but none in my apartment. I had spoken with Durham Housing Authority when the complex was giving me hell about installing strike plates for the locks, and they were very interested in coming out to inspect an apartment. It sounds like they've heard about some of the maintenance issues and were looking for someone who was currently renting to let them look at an apartment management hadn't 'fixed up'. Of course none of that was, or could be, said out right, more just very interested in coming out to look at my apartment. Unfortunately I had to take an emergency trip out of town that week and by the time I was back the lock issue was resolved and I didn't feel like taking a day off work to meet them. However, for tenants who do have major obvious problems with their unit it might be something to look into! I am looking at other properties in the area. I really hate moving and the expense is going to hit pretty hard right now, but I'm still planning on it.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="862018"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">04/22/2014</span></div><p>Does your unit have layer upon layer of uneven paint? Probably covering up mold &amp; mildew. Especially baseboards in bottom units. Probably ceilings of top units. Check the a/c closet for corrosion &amp; built-up crud. That might be the musty smell. There are a lot of gaps around light switches, pipes, etc. so bugs just come in through the walls. Shoddy building maintenance in general. You didn't say if you opted to move? (The snake is interesting, but shouldn't detract from real management issues.)</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="111311885"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111310083" data-beginyear="2014" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="2" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20140418"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/18/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Negative reviews seem to generate anonymous glowing reviews&#44; falsely increasing the overall rating.

Our beautiful renovations have only enhanced our property and we are looking forward to welcoming many more happy residents in the years to come. We appreciate your feedback and invite you to contact the management office so we can rectify any outstanding concerns.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="861419"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">04/19/2014</span></div><p>thanks for posting -- my children won't be subjected to this now!-- won't spend time looking at the place -thanks for posting</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="111310083"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111277722" data-beginyear="2011" data-endyear="2014" data-responses="1" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20140302"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2011 - 2014 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/02/2014</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I lived at Park Ridge Estates for the last 3 years. I also lived there&#44; several years ago&#44; and I came back because of the great apartment location and community. I only left this time because I purchased a home. I loved my one bedroom top floor apartment. It had cathedral ceilings&#44; was the perfect size and overlooked the wooded area behind the apartments. It was always very quiet&#44; and I enjoyed coming home to that relaxing atmosphere. I also liked that the apartments are pet-friendly. My cats enjoyed watching the birds from the floor-to-ceiling windows. It was a good space for all of us. The management has done a fantastic job with upgrading the property and apartments. It has really transformed since I lived there many years ago&#44; even though I loved it back then&#44; too. There are walking trails behind the apartments&#44; but just walking through the community is nice&#44; with all the pretty landscaping. I also appreciated being able to get free coffee at the leasing office. They have a Keurig machine and are always stocked with different coffee blends&#44; plus a variety of teas. I worked from home often&#44; so being able to pop down for a nice coffee was great. Everyone there has been very friendly and helpful. I appreciate all the updates they&#39;ve made and the way they keep the community clean and maintained. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I lived at Park Ridge Estates for the last 3 years.

The maintence staff is pretty great here. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3069961" data-review-id="111218893"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="62527"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">11/27/2013</span></div><p>Thank you for providing a review.

When I first moved in&#44; right away I noticed how shotty everything was. Huge paint drips running down doors and walls&#44; cheapest bathtub I&#39;ve used&#44; thin flimsy doors&#44; cupboard doors that broke right away. And my shower leaked into the downstairs neighbors! You can also hear every step the neighbors above you take! I&#39;ve been in three different apartments (visiting neighbors)&#44; and it is the same in all. The hot water also takes a very long time to reach even the nearest sink&#44; and the water (regardless of temperature) is always cloudy. There are cockroaches everywhere in the kitchen&#44; they &#39;spray&#39; for bugs a few times a year&#44; but it is not effective. Everyday I am killing at least one cockroach in my kitchen. I have two pets and they are both covered in fleas&#44; as is my bedroom. I&#39;ve never had a problem with fleas before. You pay for water and garbage here. Speaking of garbage&#44; there is no lighting near the big garbage bins&#44; which is surrounded by big bushes and trees. I was very scared the one evening I took the trash out after the sun went down. And the only sidewalks are in front of the buildings and the office. If you walk your dog&#44; you have to walk in the street or the grass. In the weight room&#44; nearly everything is broken and the room smells moldy. I tried to use the restroom once and only one light in the far corner worked&#44; no toilet paper&#44; and there was poop all over the seat. The staff is pretty unhelpful. Several times I&#39;ve had packages sent to me&#44; which I&#39;ve needed to collect at the office. It takes 2-3 times for each package before someone will find my package. They always have some flimsy excuse&#44; as if it&#39;s not their fault for not finding my package. Why would I have a notice in my mailbox that I have a package&#44; if my package isn&#39;t at your office? This is very frustrating and I am worried that my&#44; often expensive&#44; packages will not turn up. The parking lot is often nearly full when I get off work&#44; and the Visitor parking spots are so far from my apartment I don&#39;t want visitors. We used to have an enclosed screen porch&#44; but they &#34;repainted&#34; the porches (more dried globs of paint!) and refused to put them back up&#44; claiming &#34;people like putting their plants out.&#34; I suspect they merely didn&#39;t want to pay more money to put screens back up. The porch is now useless to me as now I cannot open the sliding door without more bugs coming into my home&#44; and I cannot supervise my pets. Now if you look through the complex&#44; nearly no one has anything on their porches. Also&#44; sunlight does not come into my apartment&#44; at all. At 3pm&#44; even in the summer&#44; I must turn lights on to see. My pets are miserable not having sunny spots to lay in&#44; and several of my plants died (oh yeah&#44; the porch doesn&#39;t get much sunlight either). And in the master bedroom&#44; a window popped off track so maintence came to fix it. It now cannot be opened. As for AC/Heating&#44; it only cools/heats the few rooms by the heater&#44; and barely touches the master bedroom and it&#39;s bathroom. And finally&#44; from what I understand&#44; the owners of this complex are not residents of North Carolina. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I&#39;ve been living here for awhile&#44; and it is one of the worst place I&#39;ve lived.

I have rented apartments for ~10 years and have lived here about two months and have wanted to move out since about day 1. With the exception of Sarah in the front office&#44; the others are clueless&#44; worthless employees who will not respond to emails. I moved in being told that the apartment was fully renovated and these are the problems I have had to date: apartment not ready for move in (was told on day of move in to wait due to them not being finished)&#44; paint is peeling off door frames and corners (from not being painted properly)&#44; cracks and missing paint on walls&#44; broken window (tracks broken and the window fell out at me-- they proceeded to break my antennae for my tv when they were fixing this)&#44; hot water heater had corroded pipes (told that hot water heaters in apartments are not like those in other places and they won&#39;t look the same... Pretty sure corrosion is corrosion whether it is here or on the moon)&#44; A/C has broken 2 times (after I informed them that the thermostat wasn&#39;t reading correctly)&#44; mold in the bathroom (visible and in large quantities at move in)&#44; metal strips in between living room and bathroom not installed properly (cut my foot on this and it required multiple service calls to fix)&#44; the pipes were not connected to the sinks (drained into the cabinets for the 1st day until I fixed them)&#44; door to laundry room was half attached to the hinges until I fixed it&#44; air filter installed wrong&#44; door to patio they WILL NOT install weather stripping even though I can put my hand underneath it (I was told that if you completely seal a door properly it won&#39;t open --by the property manager)&#44; lights not installed for move in&#44; and the dryer vent needed fixed at move in (when their maintenance staff came in to fix it&#44; they destroyed the flooring and are currently blaming it on me). On my day of move in a guy got arrested for assault in my building (not super safe). I can hear a baby crying in the building and my neighbor has parties until 3/4am on week nights. Again I repeat-- Do Not Move here. I have been trying to contact the property manager since the beginning of August and she will not respond to emails. Parking-- There are permits for parking (which is great you think)&#44; but somehow people have &#39;special&#39; permits and you get yelled at if you are in their &#39;spot&#39;. Though there is no mention of this at move in&#44; and the office ladies will not respond to why this is. Also&#44; the lights do not light up the whole parking lot&#44; so if you work late it is not fun coming home in the dark. Finally-- If you love living among cockroaches&#44; this is the place for you... If you are like the rest of the world and do not-- DO NOT MOVE HERE! They &#39;sprayed&#39; for bugs and since then I have seen a plethora of bugs in my apartment. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> DO NOT MOVE HERE!

Pretty sure corrosion is corrosion whether it is here or on the moon)&#44; A/C has broken 2 times (after I informed them that the thermostat wasn&#39;t reading correctly)&#44; mold in the bathroom (visible and in large quantities at move in)&#44; metal strips in between living room and bathroom not installed properly (cut my foot on this and it required multiple service calls to fix)&#44; the pipes were not connected to the sinks (drained into the cabinets for the 1st day until I fixed them)&#44; door to laundry room was half attached to the hinges until I fixed it&#44; air filter installed wrong&#44; door to patio they WILL NOT install weather stripping even though I can put my hand underneath it (I was told that if you completely seal a door properly it won&#39;t open --by the property manager)&#44; lights not installed for move in&#44; and the dryer vent needed fixed at move in (when their maintenance staff came in to fix it&#44; they destroyed the flooring and are currently blaming it on me). On my day of move in a guy got arrested for assault in my building (not super safe). I can hear a baby crying in the building and my neighbor has parties until 3/4am on week nights. Again I repeat-- Do Not Move here. I have been trying to contact the property manager since the beginning of August and she will not respond to emails. Parking-- There are permits for parking (which is great you think)&#44; but somehow people have &#39;special&#39; permits and you get yelled at if you are in their &#39;spot&#39;. Though there is no mention of this at move in&#44; and the office ladies will not respond to why this is. Also&#44; the lights do not light up the whole parking lot&#44; so if you work late it is not fun coming home in the dark. Finally-- If you love living among cockroaches&#44; this is the place for you... If you are like the rest of the world and do not-- DO NOT MOVE HERE! They &#39;sprayed&#39; for bugs and since then I have seen a plethora of bugs in my apartment. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3022597" data-review-id="111166572"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="manager-response"></i><span class="link1">1</span><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>5 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="5"><div class="response " data-response-id="810120"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/20/2013</span></div><p>Amazing how quickly office staff respond with &quot;anonymous&quot; replies to try to make Park Ridge look good. The roaches are everywhere in these apartments. The people don't bring them its Park Ridge not properly taking care of its apartments. I'm glad the apartment staff have time to try and cover on here with fake reviews instead of taking care of the DUMP apartments they are trying to rent out.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="810222"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/20/2013</span></div><p>Too funny....everybody responds Anonymous and I am not office staff ..I am a resident. No roaches in my nice apartment. I usually don't respond to this kind of negative crap but felt the need too. I am sure the staff does not have time to sit here and post fake responses. They are working. I read through alot of this stuff and I cannot believe people actually put such insulting remarks about people (staff)on these reviews. Park Ridge is not perfect but it is by far a dump. That's pretty harsh, there are alot of residents that like it here. I have talked to long time residents. So crazy.....</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="809372"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/16/2013</span></div><p>I can agree with the first post. I moved from an old apartment to a &quot;renovated&quot; one. These apartments are NOT renovated. They are covered up! When I moved in, our bedroom door would not shut, the A/C did not work, the toilet ran in the 2nd bathroom, the front door was not sealed properly, and the shower ran in the master bathroom. Did I also mention that we have had two leaks into the apartment as well? My neighbors are little punks who play loud music and I have called the office about 4 times AND THE COPS and nothing has been done. This place is absolutely HORRID. STAY FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="807327"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/10/2013</span></div><p>Do not waste your time with the property manager instead ask for the regional manager's boss phone number. The regional manager is also worthless so start as high up as you can. The regional manager told us we were lucky we had never had cockroaches under oh really! That was just insulting. They hate folks that make waves so beware and the last month we were there they lost our check then tried to charge us late fees. Make all payments in person and get a receipt. Lastly call the Durham housing authorities and keep a diary of all your issues and their unwillingness to address things in a timely manner and if repairs are not done to your satisfaction.</p></div><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="50810"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">09/05/2013</span></div><p>We appreciate your review and do apologize that you have had a difficult move in experience here. While Park Ridge is undergoing many extensive interior and exterior renovations, minor repairs may still be necessary in each apartment renovated and non-renovated. We strive to have any interior or exterior repair noted in a work order so that our staff can ensure that all repairs are made by a maintenance team member or a contractor if needed. As a courtesy, we do offer some of our residents to have a reserved parking space due to a handicap which is verified via documentation. These residents are required to have a parking permit like every other resident. In the event of a resident disturbance, upon notification, it is our duty to ensure the well-being of our residents. Regardless of where a person chooses to live, unexpected events may occur. If you would like to set up an appointment to meet with the property manager, please feel free to contact the office. We really hope that your continued stay at Park Ridge can be a pleasant experience and we appreciate your feedback.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="111166572"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111142195" data-beginyear="2009" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20130801"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2009 - 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 08/01/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Lived here for several years and there was a steep decline.

We are sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your residency at Park Ridge Estates and apologize if you feel you were mistreated by any of the office staff. We are always looking for ways to improve our community for our residents. In fact, we are currently doing both interior and exterior renovations. We offer routine preventative pest control quarterly to each apartment. If a resident requests extra treatment, we provide that as well at no cost to the resident. The interior renovations consist of completely new cabinets and countertops, all white appliances, all new lights and brushed nickel fixtures, and wood vinyl in the kitchen and bathrooms. The exterior renovations include the pool and new pool furniture, additional seating and lighting in the gazebo area, resurfacing and painting of the tennis courts, additional seating at the dog park, 24 hr. renovated fitness room, resurfacing and paving of the parking lot, and fresh paint and repairs in the breezeways and exterior of the buildings. We invite you to come back to visit our community and see the improvements.

WTF so everybody swells misses work can't sleep and doctor visits that I had to pay for. So after going numerous times to management they offer me a new unit cool so what I Think is cool..so as I'm moving I get curious about my unit and asked my neighbor about the people who stayed here before me and voila they had the same damn issue so management knows about the problem and not doing anything about it sounds like money is more important to them than life...Tell management not to paint over the mold or try to say we can clean your carpets just gut the the unit out to rid the problem but I guess it would cost them to much MONEY to do so huh...NOW back to my move same set up I'm feeling good and I touch my bathroom drawer and it falls off and in the kitchen, I purchase a washer and dryer now mind you the cord to the dryer does not fit so that tells me these units are old, they hooked me with free cable and water and blam snatch that up then my neighbor moves cuz they have mold in their bedroom and painted over it and moved someone else right in after..NOW WE HAVE ROACHES AND MANAGEMENT has yet to make a move I can not wait till my lease is up I'm out of here do not move here you will pay way to much and get tricked into JOE'S APARTMENT and I.

Residents have yet to be provided the contact information for that courtesy officer mentioned. When residents call the office after hours for emergencies, generally they are not given information regarding the courtesy officer, and the courtesy officer is not contacted. So, how is that helpful for tenants during an emergency situation? Mold seems to be an issue here. One suggestion: call Attorney General (Carol Johnson 919-716-6021) and Environmental Protection Agency (919-541-2258).</p></div><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="14695"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">07/26/2012</span></div><p>We strive to keep our valued tenants and guests as comfortable as possible.

In an effort to update the community we have recently made some changes. We listened to the wants of our residents and the outside community and no longer offer bulk utilities, allowing residents the freedom to choose services such as cable and internet based on their own needs. We adjusted those fees accordingly. There are many street lights located throughout the parking lots as well as outside building lights and interior breezeway lights. This is all in an effort to keep the community brightly lit 24 hours a day. If you ever see a light that is dimming or out, please let the office know immediately. We strive to complete work orders within 48 hours of notification. If there are any outstanding issues in your apartment please let us know so we may address the issue. As always, if you ever have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for choosing our community.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="694530"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/10/2012</span></div><p>Technically, they didn't lower the rent. The cable and water was ALREADY added to the rent and since they separated the bill charges, they graciously took off what they had been adding the WHOLE time. Bottom line, by separating it, you can see that the bills you receive now are probably more than what you were paying before the separation took place. Also, please notice that the company they are using to send residents their monthly statements is charging an admin fee for sending the bills. Check your statement. Residents are being charged for the billing service that Park Ridge set up.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="1450806"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1429426" data-beginyear="2011" data-endyear="2012" data-responses="2" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20120425"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2011 - 2012 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/25/2012</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Ive lived here for almost a year now&#44; and can&#39;t wait to renew my lease. Apartment hunting in this area was not a fun trip for me. Several places wanted me to sign a lease before I saw any of the apartments itself&#44; and I even put in a deposit for another apartment and set a move in date with them before the current tenant said they decided not to leave and I was told &#34;too bad.&#34; When I stumbled upon Park Ridge Estates&#44; I was pleasantly surprised! The people in the office were so helpful and professional. In other offices I felt like I didnt get much help or respect because I am young&#44; but Park Ridge was a different story. The buildings are older (built in the mid 80s i think I was told?)and some of my appliances are older as well&#44; but it has been a wonderful experience to live here! I can submit work orders with ease on the website&#44; and each one I submitted received a response the very next day. I once had a leak by the window after a big storm&#44; and the workmen fixed it the next day&#44; sealed it&#44; and after several bad storms&#44; have never had a problem since. To my fortune&#44; I have never seen mice or roaches or anything of the sort since I&#39;ve lived here. The landscaping is also beautiful! The drive through the front entrance is pleasant&#44; and the grounds are well kept. It&#39;s a friendly neighborhood and I always feel safe. The parking lots are well lit&#44; so I feel safe walking to my car or taking out the trash. The pool area is also very nice&#44; and recently redone if I recall correctly. Grills nearby the pool are a plus as well! If you choose to live at Park Ridge Estates&#44; I hope you have as much of a pleasant experience as I have!

I am so happy to call this place my home and love the convenience of being near so many restaurants and shopping centers. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2703167" data-review-id="1429426"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>2 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="2"><div class="response " data-response-id="679087"><div class="responseTitle"> honestfriend <span class="reviewDate">07/28/2012</span></div><p>I am actually a resident, sorry to disappoint.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="651477"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">04/29/2012</span></div><p>WOW you can't tell the office staff wrote this one!

In that time&#44; my AC broke at least 5 times. And it took maintnence at least two days each time to come and fix it. This really wouldn&#39;t have been a huge issue had I not moved in with a 9 month old and was 6 months pregnant with my second. Within a month of living there&#44; I noticed water dripping from the AC vent and into the living room carpet. Mold was starting to grow on my stuff. I alerted the staff and by the time I left there in October they still had done nothing about it. I had to throw out a lot of my stuff because mold was growing in my living room carpet. The floor in my kitchen was rotting out and I felt like I would be visiting my downstairs neighbor if I didn&#39;t practically walk on eggshells in the kitchen. The garbage disposal cracked and leaked everywhere and it took them almost a week to replace it. The wood in the cabinets warpped and rotted and ripped out. And another big issue&#44; there was a MOUSE in my apartment. I called the office and was told they would do something about it in a few days. UM NO. I went and bought a mousetrap&#44; caught&#44; and released the mouse elsewhere. The office staff is so unbelieveably rude and know nothing about anything. The parking is hard to find&#44; especially when you have people parking in 2-3 spaces so no one parks near their car. Maintence was a joke&#44; I could have done better repairs on my stuff. And I&#39;m not at all rasist&#44; but if someone is going to come into my home to fix things&#44; they need to speak English. I need to be able to understand you when you speak to me.

I have been at Park Ridge almost a year now, and am happy to renew my lease soon! The office staff have always been very helpful and friendly. Its so easy to put in a work order online, and I have always had immediate responses to any issues, solved in less than a day!

Interesting b/c I pay my rent on time (actually early most of the time), I'm a good neighbor, and take care of my apartment and Park Ridge is still a dump. Apparently you haven't had any real problems yet like many of us including mold, pest control issues, lack of heat, properly working appliances, or air conditiong. If you had you won't be singing their praises for a lonely cup of coffee. I hope your words don't come back and bite you but then again maybe a good dose of reality is what you need.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="1324459"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1324435" data-beginyear="2011" data-endyear="2011" data-responses="2" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20110923"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Prospective Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"><INTL name="visited">Visited</intl> 2011 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 09/23/2011</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I toured the apartments with a friend a few weeks ago and it was an experience.

Perhaps there is some confusion as to the actual location in which you toured. Our one male staff member has not been at the Park Ridge Estates location for almost two months and it is company wide policy (the manager included) to treat every individual and resident in a professional and respectful mannger. In regards to your paraphernalia worry, Park Ridge Estates has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for the sale or use of illegal drugs on premises. Our residents must pass a rigorous background check to be allowed to reside in the community. Not only do we have law enforcement members who choose to live in our community because of the quiet surroundings, we also have an on-site courtesy officer who walks the premises regularly to ensure all outside lighting is working properly. As an established apartment community, we are nestled right next to the Tobacco trail between woods and privately owned housing communities. Our apartment homes are reflective of older apartment models and have a retro-style feel to them. We are proud of our community and take special care to ensure that each apartment home is properly maintained and pleasant to live in.

If I were looking to move here&#44; I would disregard the previous 9 entries during this month and look back to what previous people stated. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2580828" data-review-id="1319796"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="1319796"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1319699" data-beginyear="2006" data-endyear="2011" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20110914"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2006 - 2011 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 09/14/2011</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;ve been at Park Ridge since 2006.

When I first moved in&#44; this place seemed too good to be true...well&#44; it was. There were 2 great office staff employees but now they are gone so now the entire office staff is a joke. The parking sucks and there is not enough light at night in the parking lots. The grounds are dirty and the breezeways in between the apartments look like they have never been cleaned. They don&#39;t require background checks so you never know who your neighbors are. I see cops coming in and out all the time (and not for added security&#44; they call because someone called 911!!!). There has been plenty of vehicle break ins. The fixtures in the apartments are all old and dated. Repairs are made to simply cover up the problem and not actually fix it. The people below me smoke inside their apartment so my place constantly smells like cigarette smoke and weed. They also don&#39;t know how to parent their children because they scream and carry on during all hours of the night. The gym is a joke and the only way you can get to it is by going around the main office and it&#39;s sketchy back there -- would NOT go at night. The maintenance department is a joke. My A/C broke in the heat of the summer and it did not get fixed for 2 months. UNBELIEVABLE! Don&#39;t live here.

EVEN THOUGH THE RENT IS CHEAP IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1969723" data-review-id="925796"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="925796"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="909431" data-beginyear="1997" data-endyear="2001" data-responses="0" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20090413"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 1997 - 2001 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/13/2009</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> listen everyone...i use to be maintenance here and the apartments are basically good.

PRG is&#44; well&#44; in my opinion&#44; a slum lord. Look at the other properties they run (Cary Pines&#44; Woodcreek&#44; etc....how many murders?) Anyway&#44; from time to time their employees try to sugar-coat their crappy properties by posting positive reviews that focus on their major advantages&#44; while also mentioning minor disadvantages. It is a psychological method that makes them seem credible. For example&#44; yes&#44; ParkRidge is located in a fantastic place if you want to work in Durham or Raleigh.

PRG is&#44; well&#44; in my opinion&#44; a slum lord. Look at the other properties they run (Cary Pines&#44; Woodcreek&#44; etc....how many murders?) Anyway&#44; from time to time their employees try to sugar-coat their crappy properties by posting positive reviews that focus on their major advantages&#44; while also mentioning minor disadvantages. It is a psychological method that makes them seem credible. For example&#44; yes&#44; ParkRidge is located in a fantastic place if you want to work in Durham or Raleigh.

All we want are truthful reviews without all the backbiting and paranoia. Can't someone just tell us what it's actually like without 10 other people freaking out? My visit to Park Ridge was short (roughly and hour), but the staff were amenable and built great rapport. The apartments seemed well cleaned and the smell of mold did not hover in the air. It was midday, so I wouldn't know what the noise was like, but over all it looked like a nice place. We could be moving here within the next couple of months from another state...and now I'm just very worried that my first impression is incredibly wrong.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="294268"><div class="responseTitle"> lafr <span class="reviewDate">01/11/2009</span></div><p>What ever!!!!!! Post like this sounds fishy to me. We moved because of the mold and noise. We paid our rent on time. Where we live now I do not here my neighbors. Go locations was about the only good thing about these apartment. The pixs posted are mine and they just covered up the mold. That does not fix the problem. And there are on going issues with the city of durham coming out. So that is bull. The only apartments that they keep up are the ones closes to the rental office. Those are the first thing would be rentals see.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="294279"><div class="responseTitle"> puhlease1 <span class="reviewDate">01/11/2009</span></div><p>I have lived in Park Ridge for about six months now, and I agree with the review - it's an older complex, with older complex issues. There are kids (college) who seem to be running the place, and they can do a below adequate job sometimes), but yes, it's a great location, and feels like you're living in the woods. I've had issues with my refrigerator leaking - started with about once every two weeks, I'd find a puddle on my floor, call for maintenance, they'd be here the next day to flush out whatever it is they flush out, and it would be good for awhile, then burp out more water. It has been several times, and now I'm calling them to replace it, as it is getting worse now. We'll see what happens. I'm lucky, in that I'm in a building with people who seem to be relatively quiet. I'm on the second floor. And, when I have a gathering in my place, the lady downstairs doesn't appear to hear much, though I'm careful to ask her to let me know if she does. All in all, while it might not be the best place in the world, it's relatively cheap, the apartment space is good, and it's in a good location. I don't think I'd want to live in on of the &quot;garden&quot; (i.e., basement) apartments though. I'm betting they get a bit damp.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="294303"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">01/11/2009</span></div><p>Seems that the same old people are doing the same thing!

Attention prospective residents- I have argued with one of the office staff members, through this site, that is writing positive reviews for this apartment complex. Please find below comments which indisputably show their effort to induce you to rent at their complex without fair information. First, I will provide you with one of the more pertinent comments provided by their employee in their effort to gain credibility. Second, I will provide you with my response which indisputably refutes their credibility. Please be aware of what this company does. Regards.

You really are bitter, aren't you' I can see why people don't want to leave ratings here, because they get attacked by people like you. It's creepy. It's like you're watching this one site just to attack people. I said I wasn't a staff member, because I had read other reviews that were actually written by people like you (or maybe you) accusing them of being staff members. No way in hell I'm giving you my card - why, so you can harass me in person and creep me out further' But hey, call the Durham Center in Durham - 560-7100, and tell them you would like to be screened for mental health services. They will do the screening, and recommend a mental health agency in the community. Oh, and I'm 42 - I was raised in the 70s and 80s Bill and Ted era. Most of us say &quot;dude&quot; :) I STATED-------------&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey, the Bill &amp; Ted era didn't start until February 17, 1989. You would have been roughly 21 back then- a far cry from being &quot;raised in the 60s and 70s.&quot; That is unless you were incredibly slow- to the point of mental retardation- which is not a funny topic. SEE AUTHORITY AT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dude The only time the term &quot;dude&quot; was used in the 70s was- 1972 - &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, a hit single performed by Mott the Hoople, written by David Bowie. 1973 - Dude, a musical by Galt MacDermot. 1978 - Big Wednesday, a film drama depicting the surfer life in the '60s and '70s. There is nothing stated about &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; in the history of the word &quot;Dude&quot; until 1989. But hey, you wouldn't be making stuff up or anything, wikopedia is incorrect, not you! HAHAHAH- YOU ARE SUCH A STAFF MEMBER!!! Next time- don't get into details, you will only get caught- case and point! Good luck on the job, because the comments are staying on this site as an example of what y'all do in the office over there! YOU BE THE JUDGE!!!!!!!!!!!

Maybe it was the manager... he's a little older than the rest of them. Either way, it's ok to be upset, and you probably don't need to get checked out. I completely understand having a complex about this company's employees, though, because of they way they act. Please, let's keep this conversation about the apartments and not about each other's character. Everybody's an *ssh*le on the internet, and we all know it, so if the employees want a voice, I think it's fair, but it's also fair for them to plainly and visibly identify themselves (says me, posting anonymously) ...

However&#44; the location and the price just couldn&#39;t be ignored&#44; and I moved in July 2008. I&#39;ve been here a little over a month&#44; and plan on providing updates here as I can. In the meantime&#44; I&#39;ve actually had good experiences here. I live in a 2nd floor one bedroom&#44; and I love it. Yes&#44; the carpet is a few years old&#44; but it was cleaned when I moved in&#44; and the spots that came back through after drying were taken care of with some Resolve. The location is amazing&#44; right off 54 across the highway from Southpoint Mall. I have a nice Food Lion (nicest one I&#39;ve ever seen) and a Harris Teeter 1/2 mile to the right&#44; and a Kroger and another Harris Teeter 3/4 mile to the left. It&#39;s edging the nice area of Woodcroft&#44; and that&#39;s a big plus. It&#39;s away from the bus line&#44; so I&#39;ve never seen anyone panhandling or being shifty&#44; which is a big plus from where I lived before. I have had a couple general maintenance issues since I&#39;ve moved in&#44; but nothing serious. And&#44; each time I told the office staff I had an issue&#44; it was less than 48 hours later it was fixed. My kitchen sink garbage disposal was clogged and not working&#44; and it was fixed while I was at work the next day. My refrigerator leaked&#44; and again&#44; there was a work order on my counter the next day. Big thanks to -----&#44; who seems to be the person signing the work orders. :) When my washer/dryer were delivered late in the afternoon&#44; maintenance left me a note asking me not to use the washer that day because a valve leaked. It was fixed and hooked up by the next afternoon. Parking can be a hassle&#44; especially when idiots park in no parking zones. I do wish property management would follow through on threats to tow. Otherwise&#44; it&#39;s not any worse than any other apartment complex. Is my apartment perfect? No&#44; of course not - if it were&#44; I&#39;d be paying $900 a month for it. I did get a deal on my apartment by a happy accident&#44; and most apartments in my range are $709.00&#44; but I think that&#39;s a deal&#44; too. But the layout is great&#44; the walk in closet is humongous&#44; and it being right on walking trials all over Woodcroft&#44; as well as having a really well-equipped fitness room and nice pool makes it well worth it. What I REALLY like is the layout. Whoever initially built these places thought about the quality of living where sound is concerned. Adjoining walls on the same floor are kitchen&#44; bathrooms&#44; and closets&#44; so bedrooms and living rooms are not sharing a wall. I don&#39;t hear downstairs neighbors&#44; and while I have neighbors across the hall that have a somewhat barky dog&#44; I only hear it when I&#39;m in the hall&#44; not when I&#39;m in my apartment. Halls are open and well lit with sunlights in the roof&#44; but tacky looking with popcorn celings peeling away and bugs. Feels a bit like summer camp at times LOL. For the other negatives: Yep - college students seem to be the norm in office staff&#44; and turnover seems high&#44; but they&#39;ve all been friendly and willing to help out if there is an issue&#44; and were willing to ask someone if they could not answer my questions. I don&#39;t think the dumpsters are emptied enough&#44; and they need to have more recycling bins because they&#39;re always overflowing so when it rains&#44; plastic bottles are floating down the hill. To me though&#44; these are issues that should be fixed&#44; but are not dealbreakers. By the way&#44; no&#44; I&#39;m not a staff member or someone they&#39;re paying to write this. I&#39;m a real live renter with no stake in anything&#44; so get a life and don&#39;t flame me. I&#39;m stating my experiences here. My apartment is roomy&#44; the air conditioning works great&#44; it&#39;s quiet&#44; and I hope they don&#39;t jack my rent way up next year because I plan to stick around. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> When I read the reviews here&#44; I had to think hard about renting here.

Ok!!! First, I really appreciate you wanting to provide regular updates on ParkRidge Estates. Either you are bored, or you &acirc;&euro;&oelig;care&acirc;&euro;&#157; so much about future residents that you would like to start a &quot;blog&quot; here. At first glance, your comments kinda smell like those of a staff member, BUT WAIT (it gets better) - you then detailed everything from amenities, location, local businesses, maintenance, staff members, common areas, floor plans, and my favorite, how you were looking for the price of &quot;$709&quot;!!!! Did anyone ever tell you that liars &acirc;&euro;&oelig;lie&acirc;&euro;&#157; specifically? Had you been a resident, you would have said &quot;somewhere in the 700 range&quot;, or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;about $700.&acirc;&euro;&#157; I heard the exact same speech when I was showed the model apartment!!! C&acirc;&euro;&trade;mon, even so, if that place was built so well, why the heck does it lack the very insulation that you claim reduces noise! And why would you comment on it? It was built 30 somethin years ago- the builders must have been architectural geniuses to be make it better than apartments recently built! But, you did not stop there, you provided a &quot;catch all phrase&quot; at the end in an effort to evade being called a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;staff member.&acirc;&euro;&#157; Nice effort at trying to gain credibility!!! But, you of course are not a staff member, I wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;flame you.&acirc;&euro;&#157; HAHAHAHA!!!! For not being in the industry, you sure do know a lot about what apartment complexes do on these sites- in fact, you proved it!!! By the way, you would have to be at Park Ridge a lot longer to know that the dumpster next to the office overflows and causes bottles to run down the hill..get it...next to the office!! (More like in it). Tell ------------- I said hello and to take his staff off the websites! But, I know, you all will continue to do so forever!!! Ya gotta love PRG REALESTATE!!!!!! In conclusion, I sure hope they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t jack your rent up next year- Park Ridge is a super-stellular secret in the Durham area!!!!!! And with your employee discount, it would still go up- PRG is so cheap that they would even screw over their own employees!!!!! Why do you think turnover is so high? Pretty soon, you will be just another number!</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="255573"><div class="responseTitle"> puhlease1 <span class="reviewDate">09/04/2008</span></div><p>Damn - my response got erased, I think. Oy. So, I'll repeat. Do you really have such a boring life that you troll apartmentratings? Or maybe you're some ex angry staff member yourself. Whatever. I work in mental health - maybe I should offer you my card so you can get counseling and learn to GET OVER IT. Dude (or dudette), get a grip. I like it here (so far). I definitely care about others who move here - I want good neighbors, and not morons who don't know how to park and dumb down the joint. In my 42 years of life, I've owned my own home, and I've rented in a lot of places. Some sucked, some were neutral. I'm a detail person - so I quote exactly what I've been told are the rents. I pay less because a doofus (also ex staff member) messed up on my lease, and they honored the stupidity. Incidentally, I live at the front of the complex, so the plastic bottles flow down the hill toward ME. It has rained heavily twice in the last month. Hence the plasic flow. So, what did I do when I hated the places I rented before? I left and got the hell OVER IT. See a theme here? I like it here so far. If it starts to suck, I have the option to move. Nuff said.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="255580"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">09/04/2008</span></div><p>HAHAHA- First attack from the staff member- CHARACTER! Instead of deciding to focus on the true issue, my disagreement with your comments, you immediatly attacked my character, by &quot;trolling&quot; this website in await of a response. Alternatively, I will not seek to your level! Pertinent facts matter, not character. (which you added in your readjustment of your previous comment a few seconds ago- good call/effort! You must really care! WHY?) Please let me know your name and contact number- I accept your offer of counseling and would like you to help me move on. Or maybe you dont work in mental health? I know that typically educated people do not refer to others as &quot;dude&quot;, especially not self proclaimed 42 year olds!!! Anyway, I am awaiting your card and will provide you with a fax number so that you may properly send it to me. Hey, you offered. But hey, no worries, its not like your writing isn't reciprocal of what I would expect from a recent college graduate- you use terms that would not be typically used by mature individuals.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="822791"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="805356" data-beginyear="2007" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20080727"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2007 - 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 07/27/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> We have been at Park Ridge since June 2007. We loved the location and the price. Things were off to a bad start immediately. The apartment wasn&#39;t ready on time. Maintenance said that the last renters of our unit turned off the power&#44; so it took time for them to get it back on so that they could perform the required work. Maintenance said that they had just cleaned the carpet&#44; but would be dry in an hour. We waited an hour&#44; but the carpet was still soaking wet. And I am not exaggerating. We had to move our things onto wet carpet&#44; because we had to return the U-haul in the morning&#44; and our friend who was helping us move had to leave in a couple of hours. When the carpet did finally dry after a couple of days&#44; it was crusty-feeling. Even with the doors and windows open it took a long time -- there just wasn&#39;t much air circulation in the apartment. There are no ceiling fans&#44; and we did not own any at the time. The carpet looked old at move-in and was tearing away from the metal strips that separate carpet from linoleum at the kitchen and bathrooms. A few months ago&#44; I handed my money orders for rent to the Property Manager. I think it was 3 days later&#44; we got a late rent notice on our door. I called and told one of the staff that I handed my rent to the Property Manager a few days ago. She said that the payment wasn&#39;t in the usual place and would have to wait until Monday when the Property Manager returns to the office. They did find it&#44; but it was very unnerving for me and very unprofessional of the Property Manager. Since then&#44; we ask for a receipt every month. Parking wasn&#39;t a problem when we moved in&#44; but it seems that the complex is closer to full capacity now. At our building and at the one across from us at least&#44; people park behind others (I am assuming those people know each other&#44; or it would be a more serious problem) and along the curb (which is supposedly grounds for towing&#44; but have not seen towing yet). I know of at least 2 cars that have not moved since we moved in a year ago. They are probably disabled for one reason or another. Rent has increased $35 after that first year. At this rate&#44; I am confident we can find a nicer&#44; higher quality construction&#44; and energy efficient apartment. We renewed our lease because we were in the middle of wedding plans instead of researching apartments. We will definitely leave Park Ridge Estates after our current lease expires. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> We have been at Park Ridge since June 2007.

We will definitely leave Park Ridge Estates after our current lease expires. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1771246" data-review-id="805356"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="805356"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="765996" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="3" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20080501"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 - 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/01/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Hello my name is Monica Jenkins and I have real concerns of mold in my apartment. I just met with Jeremy Devlin (prop. manager)&#44;maintenance personnel (I think Larry) and Khalid Hawthorne (Housing Inspector-City of Durham)to investigate my apartment 5/1/08 at 11AM. During the inspection&#44; I mentioned that I had seen numerous accounts of mold documented on this site &#34;apartment ratings&#34; (past and present). Jeremy advised that these claims were not credible and simply people wanting to blast his complex. I strongly disagree. The inspector advised that if I could find any of those tenants that have complaints/issues of mold he would be more than happy to investigate further. I was so happy to hear that someone was taking this serious. Jeremy laughed at me when I told him I would try to reach out to everyone that had reported mold. He said&#44; &#34;if you have that much time to waste&#44; go ahead&#34;. I don&#39;t have time to waste&#44; but my son&#39;s health is the reason I am even taking a stand. My situation is almost settled as I am looking to move. But&#44; for the sake of new tenants please speak up as its clear Jeremy won&#39;t unless it&#39;s exposed. He&#39;s always told me he had no knowledge of mold. However&#44; while the inspector recounted situations Jeremy suddenly had a vast knowledge of them and expressed them in great detail. I was hurt. Jeremy is adamant that the mold in my apartment is due to my lack of general house cleaning and negligence. Is this the case for every resident that has mold in their apartment? If there is a person that keeps an immaculate apartment and has mold the inspector needs to document this. If my case is isolated fine...however if Park Ridge is an unsafe place to live due to mold&#44; it needs to be duly noted to the public.

But they won&#39;t spend a time to do that&#44; which is really too bad considering the great location and trails right here. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1537491" data-review-id="750525"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response " data-response-id="294157"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">01/11/2009</span></div><p>Everyone knows where ever you go rent goes up when you renew your lease.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="750525"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="724415" data-beginyear="2006" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="1" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20080127"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2006 - 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 01/27/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> This place is the worst place to live at!!!

I had to sanitize everything with no help from Park Ridge. I have complained on my LOUD neighbors atleast 15 times and they do not do anything about it.

And the same goes for dealing with neighbors. We're lucky if we get reasonable neighbors but again that's something that is hard to find in any apartment complex. Sometimes noise problems and other things between neighbors can't be resolved, management can't force your neighbors to keep their dog off the porch above you... do you see what I mean?</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="724415"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="677997" data-beginyear="2007" data-endyear="2007" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20070923"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2007 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 09/23/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> This place really could be something but the property managment chooses not to try .They choose to ignore residents cries for help and their maintenance personel needs to go to carpentry school.The only good thing about this place is location.In my opinion theses apartments are just overpriced projects.Stay where you are unless you want to be very dissatisfied.Also have your apartment checked for mold!!!!

The manager is rude and only cares if the rent is paid on time but will not address the issues going on. The crime watch is a good idea but&#44; pay attention to where the crime is happening and you might find the person committing the crime. My parents loved the apartment until my dad had to continue to go talk to someone about the air....I should have listened when my friend who used to live there told me not to move here. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I currently live in these apartments&#44; I have complained abou tmy air conditioning not working for 5 orm ore times and everytime someone new comes in and they don&#39;t know what they are doing so I leave the air off.

I was attracted to the abundance of trees and the awesome trails that surrounded the complex. Another plus was its close proximity to my job. The staff seemed nice and very attentive... that was until I signed the lease. Recently I placed a service request with management and it took 3 weeks for maintance to respond. When maintenance did come&#44; they did not fix the problem. Finally&#44; out of frustration&#44; I paid $78 to have someone fix a problem that Park Ridge Estates was responsible for fixing. Currently I have called maintenance 3 times within the past 2 weeks to fix my air conditioner&#44; which will not cool below 80 degrees. When I went to speak with management I was told that I had to understand that it was hot outside and considering I had high ceilings I should not expect the a.c. to cool below a certain temperature. I do not know about you&#44; but when the heat index is 100 plus&#44; I would like my dwelling space to be below 80 degrees. Aside from bad maintenance&#44; management is awful&#44; they are never in the office&#44; nor will they return phone calls. The breezeways not kept clean and the prices are too high for what you get. Please do not be fooled by the advertised amenities i.e. weight room and free cable. The weight room&#44; which was supposedly renovated&#44; is nothing more than a small dingy area in the back of the complex that is not safe for anyone after dark. Cable&#44; though it is cheap&#44; is included in your rent. It is not free&#44; as I was told before signing my lease. Needless to say&#44; I would not recommend this property to anyone......unless you do not care about your living area and you have money to waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I moved to Park Ridge Estates almost 1 year ago.

The maintanence people are prompt&#44; I had ants at one point&#44; but one visit from the exterminator fixed that. Any problems that I had (i.e. leaking sink) was fixed although it take him two or three times to fix the entire problem.

Upon move in my stove did not work, my oven door did not shut, my patio door did not lock, my washer hook up was so layered in paint that I was unable to screw the hose on (maintenance ruined my hoses after trying to force them on the hook up anyway), and my bathtub faucet was completely rusted through with mildew falling out each time the water was turned on. It took maintenance 2 weeks to fix these problems (which should have been addressed before I moved in). When I confronted management about these issues they were unapologetic, unhelpful and downright rude. The manager even raised her voice at me while making excuses for her sub-par maintenance staff! Talk about customer service! Not to mention, not one member of the management is over the age of 30. I guess experience has its advantages. I will admit that Park Ridge is cost effective, so I suppose you get what you pay for...I would opt for a smaller more expensive place with a nicer, cooperative, professional staff; it&Acirc;&rsquo;s worth it.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="510204"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">10/17/2010</span></div><p>BEWARE! We moved in 4 months ago and things have gone from okay to really bad! All the reviews are accurate except the manager's post who by the way needs to get a frigging clue!There are major problems with the parking, car break ins, and maintenance!!! Forget trying to get anything repaired b/c it will be weeks if not months before anything is done if you even get it repaired. We tried calling maintenance on 3 different occasions and all 3 times we got an answering maching left a message and got NO response. Don't let their false advertising lead you to believe you are getting a great deal at a wonderful complex b/c it is all a LIE! The August posting hit the nail on the head when the were referring to Ashley - she comes as cross as really nice until you sign the lease but after that she is a major B_tch with a severe attitude that needs adjusting.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="490808"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">08/18/2010</span></div><p>My apartment had roaches before I moved in and they were still there during my stay I asked for someone to come spray which they did but 3 sprays?!? That's not enough if all of my cabinets have cracks in them! Yes it is quiet but no one has YET to do anything to resolve the car break-ins. My car was got broken into and the dummys didn't steal anything but I blame the property for poor lighting outside in the deadend apartments. The staff starts out nice until something happens and then their attitude changes and u notice attitudes when you come across them they don't even speak to you anymore. The main person that iv notices this in is Ashley. She was very nice before I filled out my app back then I had a simple assult charge that wasn't suppose to be on my record so when she ran my b-ground check and she saw what was on my b-ground she was very quick to turn me down for the apt and was very quick to give me attitude. I was able to clear my b-ground and still noticed attitude from her and was able to move in. They are quick not to work with you knowingly you are paying rent by financial aid and they still let you in when your late and don't pay by the 25th they charge you next months rent and won't accept any payment until you pay the rent you owe plus next months which is not stated in the LEASE! New office manager is a ----- and tells you one thing then the next day she tells you another. Apts are spacious and quiet but the office staff likes to judge and act like --- holes and minus the break-ins I like the place. Rent was 699 for the special but somehow PARK RIDGE thinks they are top of the line now and want to charge ppl 800 and up for a 2 bedroom which isn't worth it hell it isn't worth 749 at the reg price.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="458004"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">05/20/2010</span></div><p>This place is garbage.....The Management team is horrible, I had the garbage disposil litterly come a lose and because it was Sunday, they would not send a worker out to fix it...I was on the second floor and if water had leak to the lower level I would habe been responsible....Then water was actually leaking into my apartment and I had to wait again....then every time I dried clothes water would end up on my dryer just sitting for a month I had to use the apartment facilities to do laundry....then they towed my car because I was not parked in a parking space....However there were no parking space at that time of night but they have so many broken down cars that are just sitting and have been sitting for the 2 years I was there....guess what when I moved out those cars were still sitting there....maybe if they towed those cars I would have had a parking space.

Now dont get me wrong that was an extreme plus because I wouldnt have to worry about getting money orders or writing checks and things of that nature&#44; but these people everytime they changed management would munk things up. They would forget to take the money out and then put harassing notes on my door telling me I was late with the rent&#44; and everytime I would go to the office to complain they would have some sorry excuse..like &#34;we didnt know that you were supposed to be on the list...we are so sorry!&#34; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say think long and hard about your decision before moving here!!!! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="368473" data-review-id="425943"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919493321827713" data-review-id="425943"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="425297" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2005" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20060318"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/18/2006</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> This place is just all around horrible.
