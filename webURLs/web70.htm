I found the perfect apartment... And then had it ripped away from me. The apartment was second-floor vaulted ceilings 934 sq ft 1 bedroom/1 bath with an extra Den, wooded view, classic renovation which meant tan color scheme and new carpet no washer and dryer but that was OK because I have my own. I had put my admin fee and application fee in for Beech Lake Apartments on Sunday April 30th, 2017. This was for a move-in date of May 18th, 2017. They called on Monday May 1st, 2017, after receiving my pre-approval email on Sunday aftn and stated they were going to be renovating the apartment that I had reserved. Well I got excited like every other tenant would, until they added a &quot;but&quot; to the sentence. &quot;But, I will have to charge you an extra $125 dollars per month!&quot; Because we are renovating this unit. I was already at the top of my budget and decided that I could not even entertain another $125. I tried to see if there was anyway that they could hold off on the renovations until my 13 month lease was up and they stated that there was no way of them doing this. I am just very hurt that even though I paid for my admin and applications fees to be able to hold that specific apartment for that specific amount they did something so underhanded and wanted to charge me more. These people are scam artists. I did speak with the manager Paula and she offered me another one bedroom apartment no den, bottom floor, no washer and dryer for the same initial rent that I had been given for my dream unit. In other words an apartment with 154 sq ft less and on the first floor with a parking lot view. Definitely not an offer I was going to take her up on. She then offered to lower the rent to $75 more per month. Still way out of my range. She said that if I wasn't going to take either of the two offers that I wasn't going to be renting from them. All of this aside...Ashley and Derrick both are amazing sales people and seriously the best people to work with throughout this process. Before all the craziness happened they were both very professional and courteous. Ashley was amazing at selling us on the unit and checking off all of my 'wants' in a rental. Derrick was very very nice and very personable when we were putting in our application and admin fees. This property is very beautiful but they need to be more truthful and check their facts before they set a rents. I believe they saw an opportunity to get more rent from the unit and found a way to dissolve our agreement in order to do so. I did get back my admin fee and deposit. Only because I first until I got it. Still very disappointed overall. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Worth reading before you look at Beech Lake apartments.

Still very disappointed overall. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3648034" data-review-id="112017107"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="112017107"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section reviewAd" id="reviewAd2"><div class="APAWReviewsAd2 widget"><div class="review-ad"><div id='div-rail2' class="centered-ad"></div></div><script type="text/javascript"> ibads.cmd.push(function() { if (PAGESCOPE.ads.railAdSlot2) { PAGESCOPE.ads.railAdSlot2.load(); } }); </script></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111975615" data-beginyear="2014" data-endyear="2017" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20170309"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2014 - 2017 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/09/2017</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I loved been at beech lake the community is very charming and quite.

I read the reviews on this apartment complex before moving in and just like everyone else I decided that situations happen and I would find out for myself. There are some petty people out there that you just can't please. Well unfortunately in the case of Beech Lake all the negative reviews are legit. I had a great signup experience and the office manager was the one who assisted me. She was terrific. I have no complaints about her personality or professionalism. After moving in everything just got worse. I've had to have my washing machine fixed 3 times now and this last time it took me calling the office 3 days after placing my maintenance request for them to come out to fix it. The woman on the phone was nice and did tell me she would send someone out right away. But 3 times its broken in 1 year has been extremely inconvenient. While on vacation apparently my air conditioning unit was not working and water was leaking down into apartments below it. Maintenance came in and fixed the issue but never retouched up my walls. I now have a huge water stain underneath the unit which I am assuming is now growing mold due to their lack of cleaning it up. This I have found out has resulted in my water bill being double the normal amount for 6 months. Management did not offer me anything for the expense that was not my fault but fault in their equipment. Also, when I moved in a new assistant office manager was starting named Richard, he had no idea what he was doing and was left there on a Sunday by himself. He seemed frustrated and confused and took it out on the tenants who came in to ask questions. I chalked it up to him being new and lack of training. Well its been about 10 months now and he is still as rude as ever! He has an excuse for everything even when you go in for a simple request of picking up a package, ie hes too busy, they had training, theres nothing he can do about, etc etc etc. Its like they got you to sign a lease so your locked in and now they can treat you like crap and be as rude as possible because you can't go anywhere without it costing you a lot of money. I'm sorry but the tenants are the reason you have a job in the first place. My recommendation to management.. fire him, hes costing you bad reviews and hes one of the reasons I am not renewing my lease. The thefts and vandalism are still going on. One day I walked out to my car and found one of the maintenance staff tires had all been slashed. Now whether that was coincidence or a tenant was extremely mad at him should speak for itself. I do not believe ever in ruining someones property but this is a prime example of the type of tenants the place attracts or the lack of skill the maintenance team has. Either one is a red flag! I received a letter reminding me that my 60 day renewal was coming up which I appreciated the reminder. But with it they increased my rent $80 a month. That is crazy! I understand rent increases but not by that much. When I looked at the board of available apartments I saw that my same apartment sq ft was being rented out for less than what they wanted to raise mine to. So I put in my notice! I found an apartment in Brier Creek that was way nicer, better pool, huge gym, and great area for less then what Beech Lake wanted to charge me now. My advice, do not move into Beech Lake... find another apartment complex! </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I wish I could give 0 stars!

I am not sure why she was hired. Her people skills are lacking and she has a nasty attitude. Other than what I just listed beech lake is okay. The maintenance staff is friendly and I haven't had any problems with neighbors. However, with that being said, I still wouldn't recommend this complex to anyone unless you can deal with a obnoxiously rude leasing office manager.

Don't count on her to fulfill any requests; she could take weeks to do it. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3527580" data-review-id="111829755"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="111829755"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111803936" data-beginyear="2016" data-endyear="2016" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20160602"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2016 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/02/2016</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Neighborhood" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> We moved in recently to Beech Lake apartments.

The layout of the apartment is a bit awkward. The front door of my 1 bedroom opens to a wall. It was hard moving large items like my bed and couches in because of it. Also in my apartment, I was having issues with my plumbing and appliances. My dishwasher leaks, my toilet doesn't flush like it is suppose to, my bathtub doesn't stop up properly when you lift the switch for it to, and if you turned on my stove, it automatically when into self-cleaning mode no matter what degrees I had the knob set at, and was burning anything I put in it. There is not a lot of corner space in the kitchen, and storage space is skim. Maintenance for me was an issue. My heat didn't work the entire winter. I called when I first discovered the problem and someone was sent promptly; however, once he got there, he claimed that the pipes were just frozen and there was nothing he or we could do. Winter turned into spring and we discovered that our air was not working either. Frozen pipes couldn't have been the issue this time around, so I called again. Someone was sent in a timely manner. He inspected everything, and it turned out that my control box had malfunctioned..something that could have completely been fixed the first time. Unfortunately, it always seems to take 2-3 tries for the maintenance men to fix the issues in my apartment...that's if they get fixed at all. Management changes often, so it hard to find someone you can consider reliable to help with any of your issues. The current staff seems nice enough ( Truthfully, I do everything online, so I hardly have to deal with anyone in the office.) The amenities are underwhelming. The pool is barely wade-able, the tennis court is decent, but nothing to rant about, and you have to pay for the gym. The price tag ( although a bit pricey for the caliber of apartment you are getting) is one of cheapest in the city. The area is nice and quiet. If you want somewhere affordable, Beech Lake could be for you, but don't expect anymore than a complex built in the 80's can give you. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I have lived at Beech Lake for two years, and the place isn't the worst.

I use the the pool and the clubhouse , they have coffee and snacks it's nice if you don't want to go back to your apartment . They also have a gym that is open 24/7 if u purchase a key for $15 or you can use it free during office hours , it's kind of small but it has all the basics free-weights , elliptical, treadmill, stationary bike and universal gym . The staff is very nice and attentive they have helped me with small things like sending faxes and receiving packages which is so convinient since I'm not always home to recieve them . When I first moved in my screen door broke I called after hours and left a message . The next day I had a new screen door installed , no fuss .

After several complaints&#44; the technician went out and BOUGHT 1 space heater for a 2 bedroom apartmen stating it was all the office would allow him to do ands that he would look at it on Monday. It is now Sunday afternoon and 63 degrees in my apartment. Save your time and money and lease elsewhere. These apartments are run down and inhabitable. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="3073906" data-review-id="111222959"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="111222959"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111221958" data-beginyear="2011" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="4" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20131130"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2011 - 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 11/30/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> First off&#44; I would NOT recommend living here unless of course you like being without water 2-5 times a month for half a day. Some months it was seriously once a week going without water. I know this may sound like a &#34;first world problem&#34; sort of issue&#44; but I&#39;m paying almost 800 bucks a month not including the water and sewer fee; I want water when I want it. Speaking of water&#44; you have 10 minutes before you run out of hot water while showering so use it wisely. Do you enjoy front office staff that drag their feet at every opportunity? How about staff that treat you as a nuisance? What about staff that put in minimal effort in finding your mail or staff that will LOSE YOUR RENT CHECK? If so&#44; then this place is for you. Every time (I kid you not EVERY TIME) I went to get an article of mail that was too large for the mailbox&#44; it either took two visits or gentle goading from me to at least put in a half-assed effort at finding my mail. The staff here is something else&#44; I tell you. There&#39;s a lady in the office (or was at any rate) that would bring her dog into the office at times. Other times she would chain the poor thing up outside. I know this because I literally caught him running away and grabbed his chain before he could get any further. The apartments themselves aren&#39;t awful&#44; they just aren&#39;t worth the money. They&#39;re drafty and the walls are paper thin. They haven&#39;t been updated in YEARS. But the front office? Updated about 2 years ago. The complex drops all kinds of money for the front office and the grounds surrounding it&#44; but do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the tenants living there. Our neighbors were noisy&#44; but the front staff is awful so don&#39;t expect them to do anything about it. God have mercy on you should anything go wrong in your apartment. Our air conditioner went out in the summer and it took the wonderful front staff roughly two weeks and several visits and calls from me to get someone to look at it. His response was the following: &#34;Yeah&#44; these units are old and need to be replaced. They clog a lot. It&#39;s usually ice in the line. Leave the heat until it dissolves.&#34; The heat on...in the summer...yep. A separate time the unit just randomly began leaking. We requested maintenance to come out to look at it and they came in record time at just under 1.5 weeks. He pretty much just said that there was nothing he could do and hopefully no structural damage had been done. I just wouldn&#39;t stay here if I were you. I had to because I didn&#39;t have the money to move at the time. There are indeed worse apartments&#44; but if you aren&#39;t strapped and have options&#44; just go somewhere else. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> First off&#44; I would NOT recommend living here unless of course you like being without water 2-5 times a month for half a day.

I was looking to lease here since it's been hard finding a cheaper place to live but what's throwing me isn't the resident's concerns, but the manager responses. That I won't deal with.

I, too, am a resident here of several years and my rent check has been lost, my apartment is in horrible condition, and the staff does not care about the residents what so ever. I have called several times about various issues and talked with multiple people in the office, only to get NO response, remorse, or action. Words can not express how relieved I will be when my lease is up and I can get out of this hell hole.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="828980"><div class="responseTitle"> sjmr1216 <span class="reviewDate">12/02/2013</span></div><p>Thanks anonymous. I'll be happy to rebuff any statements from this manager. Regarding the dog, since you were probably out that day, you didn't witness what I witnessed, which is, a chained pooch that escaped. I caught the dog as he tried to escape. It was the thin, blond woman who had her dog chained outside. A neighbor and the person I was living with at the time both witnessed it. I DID express my concerns and nothing was done about it. I received a letter on my door stating that rent hadn't been paid even though it had. I confronted the office manager about it and he said &quot;Oh, we didn't have your check here&quot;. Imagine his surprise when I produced a copy of the check signed by one of his staff members! Lastly, I'm not attacking the staff, I'm listing what I've experienced. I'm not making these things up; it actually happened. I'm trying to think of one positive interaction I've had with any of your crew and I can only think of two: both of which were with a kind man from maintenance who replaced our air filters. My apologies if you feel this is an attack. This has just been my experience, that's all. Proportionally, the reviews on this complex are mostly negative. 32% would actually recommend living here. This coupled with the fact that the manager is quick to defend simply lends further credence to how the other 68% feel</p></div><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="62621"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">12/01/2013</span></div><p>First off I would like to make it very clear that I have been working here since before the current management company started here, and in this time we have never lost a rent check, or had anyone come forth to even suggest that we lost their rent check. If you believe this has happened please come by the office to discuss this with us. I would also like to add that there is no employee here who chains/ties up their dog or pet of any kind. I am not completely sure why you would say such a thing, but this is simply not true. We have had an employee bring her dog to the office on a few occasions, but always on a leash. This is a pet friendly community and all pets are welcome inside and outside the clubhouse. We accept resident packages as a courtesy. We have no control over when they are delivered to our office or for the notification of their delivery. Accepting packages is a service that we offer. We are not responsible for &quot;finding your mail&quot; as we do not work for the US Postal Service. If you are having issues with your mail please contact the post office as they will be able to assist you. Please do not attack this office staff. There is not one person here who is lazy or puts in a &quot;half-assed&quot; effort. We work hard every day for each and every one of our residents and I think it is a shame you are suggesting anything less. I am so sorry that you are unhappy with so many things. If you come up here and really express all of your concerns with a member of the office, we can actually address and resolve your issues. All you have to do is ask one of us to sit down and have a calm rational discussion with you. There is always time for that. Our service team will be happy to take care of any maintenance requests you have.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="111221958"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111213901" data-beginyear="2012" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="1" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20131114"  style=""><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2012 - 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 11/14/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I have lived at Beech Lake for over a year now and have thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.

Because the one that was there when Westdale Asset Management took over seemed to enjoy yelling at residents. This sounds like something one of the two women in the front part of the office would have written; if it had been from that manager, it would likely have been extremely rude and insinuated that any problems couldn't *possibly* be anything but the stupidity of residents (the real resident &quot;stupidity&quot; was in living at such a Godawful place). If it really has changed - if Westdale Asset Management finally got rid of that manager, and finally hired enough people in Maintenance so that the folks in Maintenance weren't always swamped - then awesome. But I'm not betting on it.</p></div><div class="response manager-response-background" data-response-id="58531"><div class="responseTitle"><span class="manager-response checked-color">Verified Manager</span><span class="reviewDate">10/30/2013</span></div><p>I'm sorry you are not happy with your experience with Beech Lake.

If you do happen to be a real person (doubtful, but still), then you're d**n lucky that you haven't truly encountered the verbally abusive manager (unless Westdale Asset Management finally came to their senses and fired her). On more than one occasion when I still lived there, I saw her yell at residents. She was full of herself and her own power, and loved throwing it around. Awful person, and awful apartment complex. Out of curiosity, are they now allowing hanging plants? They still have hanging plants in their promo pictures here, but when I was at Beech Lake, they sent around rude, threatening letters to the residents, telling everyone to never ever have hanging plants (that was when they weren't busy ignoring resident's problems with not having water). At least they did finally remove the picture of the needs-to-be-condemned gazebo (did they get rid of it? Or did it just collapse from all the rot?).</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="111199091"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="111198560" data-beginyear="2013" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="1" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20131023"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 10/23/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I moved in last month and I love it here!

I notice that, all of a sudden, three positive reviews pop up here - and the management finally responds to a negative one. Very, very, very suspicious. Especially with so few details. Personally, my *leaving* Beech Lake was a blessing; was there for far too many years and far too many management changes. The latest, to Westdale, was awful. I would never, ever rent from Westdale Asset Management again, and would never recommend that anyone, not even my worst enemy, invest in such a poorly-managed organization.

I am a Duke student writing a thesis&#44; and I hear everything...my neighbors&#44; people talking in the parking lot&#44; etc. This property is very old&#44; at least 20-25 years. My floors are not even. I have only one ceiling fan and it does not work properly. I feel that I am paying for a new apartment and have an old one. The property does have nice trees and a lake.

But when I needed to extend my lease&#44; to extend the writing time on my thesis&#44; noone has been helpful. The manager is trying to raise my rent 50&#37;&#44; from less than $800 to $1220 per month. If I sign a 5 month lease&#44; which is beyond what I need&#44; my rent comes to $900&#44; and increase of 16&#37; and months beyond what I need. I am getting no cooperation.

Maintenance is really fantastic too. I had a problem with my water heater and they came out late at night on a Friday and reassured me that everything was going to be fine. They came out again the next day&#44; which was a weekend&#44; to replace it. To me&#44; that is great customer service. It also impresses me with how the staff would have a nice friendly smile on their faces and were willing to help in any situation. By far one of the better places I have lived in a long time. Sure there may be a problem from time to time with the apartment but hey that can happen anywhere. They have a staff that is finally on top of their game and it has been a real pleasure to work with them. Overall&#44; this is my favorite apartment that I&#39;ve lived in since renting.

They put a PitBull of a woman in charge and told her to &quot;sic &quot;em&quot; and she has.Her name is Anne. They will all smi;le at you while they wait for you to sign a lease but before the ink is dry they will show their real faces. There are drug dealers and gun fire out here.The pool is closed half the time, animal manure all over the place because no one cleans up after their dogs, and the water is turned off for repairs on broken pipes regularly.

The management people with Westdale Apartment Management are TERRIBLE. I cannot say it enough. TERRIBLE. Customer service is not a priority for them at all. They are accusatory and condescending and just overall rude. The buildings themselves are older and have not been maintained well. I&#39;ve lived here for almost 4 years and have seen the management change 3 times. The previous management groups were at least respectful and helpful. We&#39;ve had continual problems with a leak in our ceiling and as or recently&#44; the AC. Previous management groups would at least fix things promptly when they broke. Last summer&#44; under the new management&#44; we reported a ceiling leak and had it go unanswered for WEEKS. With several followup calls. Every time you call to follow up they act as if it&#39;s your fault and that they are just too busy elsewhere doing a crappy job not fixing things. I&#39;ve called to follow up on a maintenance request and been told the problem had been fixed when&#44; as I&#39;m standing in my apartment&#44; it clearly wasn&#39;t and there was no notice left to inform us that anyone had even been in our apartment. We once got a notice that we owed $5 for a &#34;water admin fee&#34; when I called to ask about it&#44; I was told that was a part of my water bill. And when I challenged not having paid an itemized part of my water bill&#44; the girl actually looked it up and said it was for a trash fee. I was furious. Yes&#44; it&#39;s $5 but they just made up a charge for this sheet and on top of that I wasn&#39;t aware we were supposed to be paying a trash fee. (That&#39;s $5 for you to throw your own trash into the dumpster&#44; by the way. Therefore&#44; they&#39;re pocketing $5 from 300 apartments.) I might be able to deal with a less nice apartment that needs regular maintenance if that maintenance was performed in a timely manner and the people running the show were nice and actually cared about your happiness. That is so not the case here. Westdale Apartment Management cares nothing for their tennants or customer service. (They tried to tell me once they didn&#39;t have my phone number on file...I&#39;ve lived here 4 years and have definitely conversed with previous managements.) It&#39;s my personal feeling they&#39;re pushing out the people who have been there so they can further take advantage of newcomers. We&#39;re not renewing our lease but I wanted to stay a few extra weeks while closing on my house&#44; which I called and told multiple people in the office and within 24 hours they called to tell me they&#39;d leased the apartment and I had to be out. If only I could contact whoever was moving in and warn them. Also our apartment was broken into once while living here&#44; 2 laptops were stolen. They are also constantly cutting of the water for &#34;repairs.&#34; Bottom line&#44; incredibly rude and disrespectful management staff in combination with the constant need to deal with them for maintenance = give your money to someone else. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Do not live here.

He came in with a coat and said that it was warm -keep in mind that he came in from out of the cold&#44; so of course it was warmer inside. Long story short&#44; they did nothing. Meanwhile&#44; my electricity bill is hundreds more than it has to be. Also&#44; bugs are an issue. They crawl from out of the bathroom drains. The commodes were slow or clogged when I moved in and it took them two weeks to fix one and six-weeks to fix the other. Lastly&#44; the maintenance crew drives on the grass like it&#39;s a roadway&#44; killing what could be beautiful grass. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Im here for 13-months.

They are old apartments and a lot of the leasing companies who have taken it over have done NO repairs to the place. Since I have moved here the new company has tried to appear like they care about residents but they dont. The only reason why I am still here is because I looked all over for another apartment place with this same sq footage with a equal of less price and could not find one. Springfield was charging 800 for less sq footage. By no means am I saying that Beech Lake is a good place. These apartments are old and the maintenance people they have do not know diddley squat about fixing anything. The people in the leasing office need training about how to deal with customers. They think its cool to ignore people behind glass doors like you cant see them and they think you wont catch them in a lie. My way of dealing with them is to get EVERYTHING in writing&#44; make copies of any documents you give them/sign&#44; use your resources (i.e. the City of Durham has certain Health Codes that places have to abide by)&#44; and try to avoid them as much as possible. If I could find something else in Durham at this same price range or less in a decent neighborhood I would not be here but that has not happened. I will make the best of the rest of my time here. I refuse to let this apartment community drive me up a wall. I will say the latest issue with the water is REALLY ridiculous. Checking out their &#34;blog&#34; there have been water issues going back to when Westdale took over and it looks like it was going on before that. They have been deleting posts on the blog they feel are inappropriate but the whole point of it is to voice concerns right? I dont know why they expect people to be happy about not having water for over 12 hrs or why they think deleting comments will make the problem go away. They never put a notice on my door about the water leak but made sure to put one on my door about the inspections. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Beech Lake when I first moved here was a ok place to live.

They never put a notice on my door about the water leak but made sure to put one on my door about the inspections. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2906335" data-review-id="1613836"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response " data-response-id="750403"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">03/13/2013</span></div><p>this water issue is ILLEGAL in so many ways! apartments are viewed UNLIVABLE if there is no running water. which many people here haven't had since Sunday.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="1613836"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1613102" data-beginyear="2013" data-endyear="2013" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20130312"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2013 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/12/2013</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I&#39;ve lived here for almost a year now&#44; and I REGRET IT ENTIRELY.

They give no respect or decent rent to long time renter's who stay with them. My carpet tearing mold in bathroom, water bills to high.

The workers in the office are rude and unprofessional. When people come in to apply thy are very friendly and accommodating, as soon as I moved in they started showing their true colors. I went to pay my rent yesterday and there was no one in the office, no sign was up saying they were gone. I waited for 15 minutes with 2 other residents and a staff member walked out of the office and said she didn't hear us knocking and she was in the office the entire time. I was very pissed. I have complained about all the roaches that were outside and sole times come into my home. Someone has sprayed once out of the 10 times I've called.

Most people can stay at 75 inside no matter how hot it gets outdoors. Last summer when we had the maint. guys look at it, they just crudely replied &quot;well it feels a lot better in here than it does outside&quot;. Then the genius suggested that we set the thermostat to 65 at night so it'd stay cool through the day... well that's nice but it wouldn't even go that low, plus when it's cool at night we don't need to run our AC like that. Thanks for suggesting we run up our power bill instead of fixing the AC, idiots. Also recently they've removed a stop sign at the MAIN ENTRANCE of the complex where I've almost had 2 accidents plus my parents who came to visit. They continue to take away basic needs &amp; amenities while trying to butter residents up with stupid crap like pizza pool parties. How about you give us our trash pick up service back, A-holes!</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="1472125"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1458730" data-beginyear="2010" data-endyear="2012" data-responses="3" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20120612"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2010 - 2012 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/12/2012</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> For the rent&#44; I guess I got what I paid for. ***1*** Since I have moved in 2 yrs ago&#44; they (Asst.

They never returned to paint as promised and I'm concerned that this mold which they tried to convince me was water spots, is still viable in my unit. Maintenance couldn't even fix my ice maker, my floors are unstable and the carpet is in need of replacement. The updates they started on the outside included contractors who plugged into my electricity and drove up my electric bill. By the way, I stumbled on this site because I was looking for a number to call corporate and complain. Beechlake management is not answering their phones and they are cold to residents. I've been waiting five days just for light bulbs to be replaced in my kitchen.

Because we're NOT &quot;gated&quot; - the gates came down (there's a fence, but that's NOT the same as &quot;gated&quot; - there's no access control). And yeah - we lost Valet Waste, but did they cut our rent? Of course not! And the manager and assistant manager? Awful - just awful. Really rude to lots of people, and they don't give a crap about anything here. Westdale is doing a lousy job; I never want to live in one of their apartments again. They don't have enough maintenance staff, and the place is falling apart. You can even see it in their pictures on ApartmentGuide - the one with the gazebo SHOWS how the railings are falling apart! And the management is so incompetent, they ADVERTISE that!!!!!! Oh - and the pics have hanging plants, too - even though the JUST SENT OUT another REALLY RUDE letter telling us residents how BAD we are and how we are not allowed to have hanging plants! Seriously, these people are incompetent.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="666224"><div class="responseTitle"> meb75 <span class="reviewDate">06/22/2012</span></div><p>SO TRUE!!! Im even left a month early before my lease was even up! Management sucks, very rude, and always act like Im a burden if I have a question. where is the customer service?!! and yeah.. I thought the exact same... nice my idea of making friends with the select choice of other residents!</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="665332"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">06/20/2012</span></div><p>NOT GATED! Any freak can drive in here, and they do. This was OBVIOUSLY written by someone who works for Beech Lake, so anyone looking to rent here pay it no mind. The first response above mine is absolutely right, amenities have been taken away to cut costs yet we still pay the ever-rising rent costs. And seriously, wine tasting? Save it for a different time/place... if you attend one here you'll be surrounded by the essence of g-h-e-t-t-O just like if you ever visit the pool. Have witnessed babies getting cussed at by their ghetto mama's at this pool. Not cute, especially in front of my kid. Peace out at the end of our lease Beech Lake!</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="655238"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">05/16/2012</span></div><p>This place is no longer gated, though residents continue to pay for that amenity. We know longer have the valet trash we had for the first year and a half that I lived here, but we continue to pay for that as well. New manager is rude and uncaring.This is not the same place it was.Rents continue to rise dramatically.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="1441524"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1440901" data-beginyear="2011" data-endyear="2012" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20120515"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2011 - 2012 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/15/2012</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I have lived in this complex with my husband and 2 yr old son since March 2011&#44; so a little over a year.

In the time we&#39;ve lived here the water has been cut off about 8 times&#44; for hours on end&#44; which is too long when you have a baby! I have felt like I live in a 3rd world country in this place&#44; and seeing as our rent has rised to over $800 monthly it&#39;s not worth it. We can smell all the smoke( cig & weed ) from the neighbors below us due to poor plumbing around here&#44; and we can hear everything from them. Teenagers take over the &#34;sparkling fountain side gazeebo&#34; and trash it and make tons of noise with no consequences on the weekends. So we just try to stay gone on weekends when we can&#44; which sucks. The maintenance is good BUT we cancelled a request for something and every day when I would leave with my son they were STILL coming into our apt trying to see what something was&#44; and I never knew! They were like ninja&#39;s coming and going without leaving a note or anything&#44; I could&#39;ve had bra&#39;s & panties laying out or whatever... I felt SO invaded.

They took down a stop sign at the entrance where the gate USED to be (no longer a gated community&#44; thanks guys) and we almost got hit by some idiot flying out of the complex as we were driving in&#44; b/c he had no stop sign of course. We were 1 second away from getting hit on the side my 2 year old was on. Wonderful! I called to ask when they&#39;d be putting the stop sign back up and got a snooty whatever whatever response from a staff member.

Yes&#44; that means no plumbing. The worst water experience I have ever had in another apartment complex prior to this&#44; was a lack of hot water. Yes&#44; Beech Lake did give warning in advance the water would be cut off&#44; a few days in advance in fact. This is my only experience so far of such a thing happening at Beech Lake&#44; but losing plumbing makes me wonder if I am still living in a first world country. Of all the things to lose (Internet&#44; hot water&#44; even electricity)&#44; plumbing should come last. To be fair&#44; this hasn&#39;t happened prior and I have lived here some months. The water company is still outside&#44; working hard. The problem will probably resolve in a few hours&#44; but it is late at night and I am irritated (UPDATE later during the night of May 10&#44; 2012 - it is between 10 and 10:30 pm and water is back). I will be fair and give some nice points about this place&#44; compared to other rental places I have seen - 1) Very nice office workers - They answer the phone courteously and are very polite. 2) Very nice maintenance crew 3) Very nice leasing agents - One leasing agent works in the office too. 4) Convenient short-term 3 month leases&#44; with a convenient month-to-month option if you do not renew your initial lease. It is not so easy to find a convenient lease like this and also pay less than 900 dollars a month. 5) Hardly any bugs - I have lived in horror places and positively hate bugs&#44; and I am very pleased in this department over here. I&#39;ve occasionally seen a small spider run across the wall&#44; but they stick to walls only. 6) Very spacious one bedroom apartment compared to other places&#44; even in this area where property is cheap - the main living area as well as bedroom are big! You get plenty of inbuilt closet space in the bedroom&#44; two closet areas in the kitchen&#44; and one small storage room where the washer and dryer connections are (you can rent a washer and dryer for 40 dollars a month - I left the connections unused and use the on-site laundry facility instead&#44; and consequently have even more storage space). Now some negatives (to be honest&#44; not all are the complex&#39;s fault): It&#39;s the people higher-up who are doing things wrong - they are not investing funds in important areas. The entrance right outside my ground-floor apartment is really shabby - the stairs and exterior walls are poorly painted and look old and decrepit. I probably have to maintain this area on my own since cobwebs (and spiders) are routinely outside&#44; next to my front door. I often hear occasionally foot steps from upstairs&#44; and toilet flushing. Nothing else that is private. There is too much mud everywhere outside&#44; including right outside the ground floor apartment. This may not be a problem for you. I found it cold here in April. I ran the main wall heater on&#44; an hour or so every day for many days in April&#44; and got an electricity bill between 70-80 dollars. I won&#39;t be here in winter and that is a relief - I don&#39;t have the budget for a huge electricity bill. Perhaps my feeling of cold is subjective&#44; perhaps it was just weird weather in April&#44; or maybe there is an insulation problem. At any rate&#44; you have some idea of what kind of utility bill you may get. Walking inside the complex&#44; you feel it is spacious with lots of trees&#44; few cars and few people. But&#44; there are too many large dogs which only become a problem when you are walking right outside the complex - I don&#39;t enjoy jostling for space with a dog on the narrow sidewalk where you wait for the bus. This however&#44; is not the complex&#39;s fault as they can&#39;t really change the location- the entire area (including outside Harris Teeter and Car Mike which are in walking distance) has too narrow sidewalks for both dog lovers and dog haters to walk side by side. For someone without a car who also dislikes dogs in my personal space&#44; this is an inconvenience many rentals in this area have. I think there may not be a single rental complex in Durham or Chapel Hill that doesn&#39;t allow dogs (you have to go to an individual owner for that). I found a place though with hardly any dog owners&#44; and that is much cheaper&#44; and also is more to my liking - much less mud&#44; nature&#44; etc&#44; and a much more finished exterior look which I don&#39;t have to worry about maintaining. The much better exterior will be a reason due to which I won&#39;t be embarrassed to call friends over. It also fares well on bugs (none according to reviews I read online)&#44; just like Beech Lake fares well. Of course&#44; it is also a much longer lease (a year&#39;s lease) but now I actually know that I want to be in this area longer. So&#44; Beech Lake may be unavoidable for many trying to transition to this area and save money as compared to an extended stay hotel. But whether you choose to stay longer depends on your needs. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> On May 10&#44; 2012&#44; the water supply was cut off for (as of now) more than 3 hours.

What a rip off. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2592517" data-review-id="1330415"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="1330415"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1300102" data-beginyear="2009" data-endyear="2011" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20110810"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2009 - 2011 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 08/10/2011</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Pros: updating the landscape&#44; looks nice recycling on-site valet trash service 5 nights a week plenty of parking can&#39;t really hear my neighbors in the apartments next to me low electric bills (in the $40&#39;s during summer and winter peak temperatures&#44; in the $30&#39;s otherwise) lots of closet space&#44; fireplace&#44; big laundry room Cons: Maintenance comes quickly about half the time&#44; and about half the time fixes the thing correctly.

Everything they do is rigged up and a temporary fix. My garbage disposal&#44; ice maker &#44; dryer and a number of other things went bad on several different occasions&#44; and were not fixed appropiately. On top of that &#44; they cut the water source off completely not once but twice for an unestimated amount of time&#44; and speaking of water it has an unbearing stinch which smells of rotting eggs or hair relaxer that is obviously contaminated. There are several car break ins and the tenants arent notified until weeks and weeks later. They havent had a gym nor a club house since i started my lease in apr of 2010. Lastly they TRY to make you pay a full months rent when you do not re new your lease in the month where you intend to move out ( meaning you are evacuating the property before 30 days) and they insist on mailing you the remaining of the pro rated rent within 30 days&#44; which is not included in the lease agreement. In all of my rental years I have never experienced such an atrocity!. They should be shut down due to health violations (water issues) and safety. I will not be renewing my lease there&#44; if you currently reside there I&#39;m sorry for you if you are contemplating on choosing this as your next home&#44; seriously re-consider&#44; its a headache and an awful experience. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> This apartment complex is one of the worst to reside in in Durham.

I was satisfied with the conditions and services of Beech Lake apartments for the first two years. But in 2009 the staff was completely changed and problems started. The fridge in my apartment began to work improperly. They replaced it only in two weeks after I firstly reported by an old rusty one. Late in 2009 and at the beginning 2010&#44; they started installing water-meters throughout the community. They broke the door to the small cabinet where the meter was installed. I informed the leasing office about this problem. No one ever came to look at it. A month later&#44; I informed them once again. I handed in the list of issues to be taken care of in my apartment. No one came&#44; nothing was done. I regret that I extended my leasing contract for another year .Later on my life in this community converted to a nightmare with a lot of noise and dirt. The passenger window of my car was smashed to bits. An outrageous incident occurred on September 10 2010 when they hired workers to replace walkways near my apartment. Workers started to splinter with concrete just two steps from my car. As a result the body&#44; of car was uniformly covered with dents from concrete rocky stones. On windshield there were many scratches of size up to 2.5 millimeters. I tried to speak to the community manager but she refused to talk to me. Some manager later inspected my car. Three weeks have passed but no one even tried to solve the problem by offering me any kind of damage compensation . After that&#44; I immediately informed them that I would not extend my leasing contract. No reaction. I informed them again later on. No reaction again. When I informed them for the third time&#44; the assistant manager declared that I must rent my apartment on a month-to-month-rate basis for two months before I can move out.. Lastly&#44; they took about $200 out of my security deposit without any explanation. They merely stole this money. To summarize&#44; guys never rent from Beech Lake apartments.

They constantly try to run scams on you. None of the appliances work up to par. On top of that they have cut off the water on several occasions for an unestimated amount of time, they charge you for water that has an unbearing stinch( I'm convinced it's the water from the pond.) The maintenance crew is very bootleg and by bootleg I mean they don't actually repair things they rig it up to appear to work but it's a matter of days before the repairs will malfunction again. Haven't had a proper gym or clubhouse since I moved there in 2010. It's and atrocity!!!! I agree with you 100 %.

She had a great experience&#44; so I decided to sign a lease. It was great in the beginning. Nice place&#44; good price&#44; etc... My car was broken into twice (we think it was from someone who lives in the complex)&#44; and the entire move-out process is enough to make me write this bad review. Be sure to read your lease in detail -- they need at least 60 days notice for your move-out date - I&#39;m talking about even if your move-out date is the day that your lease is up. If you fail to give them notice&#44; they will charge you rent for 60-days AFTER the last day of your lease. Also&#44; I think they are now charging renters for the water bill and valet trash services. We moved out and had to pay an extra 30 days of rent&#44; and I just received a bill in the mail for $60 worth of water that was supposedly used between the time I moved out and 30 days after. The electricity bill also reflects that someone was using the electricity after we moved out and turned in the keys. They will encourage you to move out and turn the keys in so that they can &#39;re-rent&#39; the property (and give you back what you paid) -- DO NOT BELIEVE THEM. These people are SHADY in the office and will tell you one thing&#44; and pretend they never said it in the first place. For example&#44; they knew I was moving out AT least 60 days prior to the lease being up&#44; yet never told me to my face that I needed to have anything in writing. I could probably give 50 more examples&#44; but please just do yourself a favor and live somewhere else. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I learned about Beech Lake a couple years ago from a friend who lived there.

I could probably give 50 more examples&#44; but please just do yourself a favor and live somewhere else. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2338357" data-review-id="1142681"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="1142681"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="1079739" data-beginyear="2010" data-endyear="2010" data-responses="2" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20100517"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2010 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/17/2010</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I moved to Beech Lake in January and have loved it ever since.

It says it is a gated community but they took then down and will not put then back up.They don&#39;t patrol the area nor so they have gaurds. I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. For the price you pay things should be taken care of in 3 days and cars shouldn&#39;t be broken into. I made the mistake of looking at the model and loving some things but disliking others. The walkin closet is wonderful but would gladly give it up for a safer community. The rent went up when are lease was up and then they came out with valet trash service it is helpful at times but if you leave it out there is a 25 dollar charge. When you pay that much you would think these things would not happen but they do and Beech Lake Mangement could care less. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I currently live at Beech Lake apartments and it is by far the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in.

Please REVIEW YOUR LEASE CAREFULLY before signing anything.I hope that this finds you before you sign a lease at Beech Lake. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="2031887" data-review-id="964613"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="964613"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="881492" data-beginyear="2008" data-endyear="2009" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20090209"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2008 - 2009 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/09/2009</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> The only positive that I have for this place is the pond and my dishwasher.

I&#39;ve been calling and have stopped by on several occasions trying to see when I could expect to receive my deposit back. I&#39;ve been given different dates and the &#34;oh&#44; the person that handles that is out of the office&#34; spiel on more than one occasion. I gave up on calling the Beech Lake office and resorted to calling the managment company directly. After telling the person that answered the phone my information &#44; she said that she would call me back. This was after I told her that I had been promised that the check would be mailed on March 29. I called back and was told that she was writing the checks now (March 31). From what I&#39;ve been able to research the management company has 30 days according to NC law to refund the security deposit. Since I&#39;m well beyond that 30 day mark&#44; I asked if my check could be overnighted. The lady sounded quite suprised that I would make this request. I would not recommend moving into this complex if you expect to receive your security deposit back within a reasonable amount of time. I still stand by most of what is said below. My service requests have always been handled with 24 hours of making the request. There have been times that I&#39;ve received same day service. I had an issue with my dishwasher within the first month of moving into the apartment. After two attempts to fix the problem failed&#44; I recieved a new dishwasher. All of the appliances in my apartment were replaced with new ones early in 2008. During the replacement of the appliances the kitchen counter was damaged and the new exhaust fan housing exposed parts of the cabinets and walls that had not been painted. I made several trips to the office requesting repairs&#44; but nothing happed. I took a written repair request to the office on Tuesday&#44; September 9&#44; 2008. By Thursday evening most of the repairs had been completed. The maintenance technican left a note informing me of why it would take multiple trips to address all of my issues. Overall&#44; I&#39;m satisfied with my apartment&#44; with the exception that the apartment never gets warm and the heater runs all the time&#44; even though it is set to reach a certain temperature and then cut off. My last electric bill was well over $100 for a one bedroom apartment with one person living there. That is not acceptable. The security gates are an issue. The actual moving parts of the gates have been removed&#44; so there isn&#39;t one anymore. I didn&#39;t have any issues with hearing my neighbors&#44; until a person moved in upstairs with a dog with behavior issues. I could hear the dog running up and down the hall at all hours during the day and night. They also left the balcony door open so the dog would be able to got outside if it wanted to. This wouldn&#39;t have been much of an issue&#44; except this dog doesn&#39;t like people and runs to the open window or stands on it hind legs growling and barking. I&#39;ve been afraid on several occasions that the dog was going to jump over the edge of the balcony or run through the window screen. It&#39;s not much better when the dog is taken outside for a walk. I&#39;ve not had any issues with darkness in the parking lots or in the entry way leading to my apartment. The one time the light blew&#44; it was fixed the next evening. I&#39;ve learned that not everything in any apartment is going to be perfect&#44; but you have to decide what you are or are not willing to accept. Everything is subject to personal interpretation. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I lived in the community for almost 4 years.

It seems like the apartments that are located on the same side of the office are in a much nicer area. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1802148" data-review-id="823915"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="823915"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="793724" data-beginyear="2008" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="2" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20080702"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Prospective Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"><INTL name="visited">Visited</intl> 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 07/02/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Upon touring these grounds three times as a future resident&#44; I heard maintenance talking about water leakages&#44; bug issues&#44; and the gate was broken.

I was told of a specific apartment to entice me at a rent rate of $600. However, this was not available when we started negotiations. They did give me a choice of apartments. Also, be wary of your &quot;rent&quot;. It is given as a concession so they can hit you with tons of fees if you break your lease or make even one payment late.</p></div><div class="response " data-response-id="239051"><div class="responseTitle"> yourprettystupid <span class="reviewDate">07/22/2008</span></div><p>Okay. I'll say this slowly for the pseudo intellectuals out there. When you have a unit rented, it is not removed from online advertising in real time. If you were an hour away and had not put any money down to hold the apartment, then you have no claim to it whatsoever. Most likely, when you hung up the phone to get in your car and foolishly use 1/2 tank of gas, someone walked into the office and put actual money in their hand to hold the apartment. With no money from you, your phone call wasn't worth the time it took to dial the number, let alone the fuel costs. Money talks, -------- runs the marathon. Take this idiot's advise and waste more money on attorney's fees if you would like. No money exchanged hands and they did not have you sign a contract agreeing to one price only to insist you pay another. You made the trip of your own free will. If you were really that far away, and if gas were really an issue, an intelligent person would have applied and secured the apartment online. Most, if not all, apartments offer this option. But, maybe that's too complicated. Tell me who sounds more full of crap. Me, or the person who is, not so cleverly, disquising an advertisement for legal services as a comment from a concerned reader. You didn't by chance ask this person for whom they work? Get an unexpected and obviously rehearsed sales pitch? Nevermind, I don't even want to know. If you're so smart, put these where they belong: ' e. Don't hurt yourself.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="793724"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="792181" data-beginyear="2007" data-endyear="2008" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20080630"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2007 - 2008 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 06/30/2008</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Beech Lake is very peaceful.

However&#44; when I was first moving in&#44; I sent my sister to get the key. Now&#44; I had called the leasing office a few days before&#44; and they said I had to come in and sign a little waiver-type thing allowing someone other than me to get the key... I did&#44; but when she went to pick it up&#44; they didn&#39;t ask her name and they didn&#39;t check her ID. All she said (unless for some reason my sister was lying to me) was that she was there to pick up a key for her sister (she didn&#39;t even say my name)&#44; and they just handed it over&#44; which was a little nervous. Maintenance is also sometimes right on top of things (when they are on top of things&#44; they&#39;re excellent and almost everyone has been super friendly) and sometimes seems not to have a clue. I think it&#39;s probably a lot to do with poor communication with office staff. Weeks before I moved in&#44; the manager and I had a discussion about getting a handful of things done before I actually moved in. In actuality&#44; none of that happened until several days to weeks later&#44; and after many&#44; many phone calls. One person even left a huge shard of glass (broken and several feet long) in my dining area. There&#39;s also been an issue with my dogs. From the beginning&#44; I requested to have a phone call a day in advance if someone would be entering my apartment&#44; because I wanted to crate the dogs before someone came in. My concern was not only for my dogs (running out into the parking lot&#44; etc.)&#44; but also for the maintenance staff&#44; in case they had an issue (my dogs tend to be very jump-happy around strangers). Many times I would simply get a call the day of (You&#39;re at work? Can you come home and put the dogs away?). Then it turned into &#34;We know you like to be at the apartment when work is being done&#34;. Again&#44; just another indication that the leasing office does not seem to be on top of what&#39;s going on. There have been some very nice things&#44; however. I seemed to get a pretty good deal when I moved in&#44; and I really like the layout of the apartment (though it&#39;s on the older side of things and isn&#39;t constructed the best -- kitchen/bathroom counters tend to fall apart because it&#39;s just pressboard or whatever). I also had sort of a creepy stalker situation which one particular person in the office handled with a lot of grace&#44; which I appreciated a lot. And after all the maintenance/dog drama&#44; the office staff did send a nice card with a gift card to PETCO&#44; which I thought was wonderfully sweet. There were also some new appliances that were recently installed... though I was only told the night before at about 6:00 pm that they were going to be replaced the next day (have you ever tried emptying your refrigerator and freezer and finding coolers for everything in one night? And just days before Thanksgiving&#44; no less). I&#39;ll also note on the &#34;gated community&#34; bit - not so much. Sometimes the gate is working&#44; sometimes not. Horribly inconsistent&#44; really. The key pad for dialing in is AWFUL (you have to scroll through every single name in the community&#44; which sucks if you&#39;re looking for someone who say&#44; has a &#34;W&#34; last name)&#44; and most people just end up tailing someone else through anyway since the gate timing allows at least two cars to go through&#44; and at most probably three or four. As for neighbors&#44; most people are very friendly&#44; and I think I lucked out having mostly quiet people around me (especially the fellow upstairs). It&#39;s also wonderful if you have pets (though the $300 pet fee is annoying&#44; most places do have some sort of pet fee&#44; if not pet rent); my dogs often play with lots of other dogs in the surrounding buildings. Not sure yet if I&#39;ll stay. Depends on the rent for the upcoming year. However&#44; looking at the current rent prices&#44; I&#39;ll say that for the amount of money&#44; you could probably do better somewhere else. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> Let me first say that my experience at Beech Lake has not been entirely negative.

However&#44; looking at the current rent prices&#44; I&#39;ll say that for the amount of money&#44; you could probably do better somewhere else. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="1309963" data-review-id="712740"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color switch closed"><i class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></i>1 </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="1"><div class="response " data-response-id="299331"><div class="responseTitle"> anonymous <span class="reviewDate">01/27/2009</span></div><p>Very TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i HAVE STAYED AT BEECH LAKE WISH I KNEW THESE THINGS BEFORE I MOVED IN I HATE BEECH LAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="712740"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="703544" data-beginyear="2006" data-endyear="2007" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20071202"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2006 - 2007 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 12/02/2007</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I moved into Beech Lake last year. I have had so many problems since moving here that I&#39;m leaving at the end of my lease. First of all&#44; let me say&#44; when i first moved in&#44; things were great. I love the layout of the apartment for me and my little boy. However&#44; I turned in my move in inspection&#44; nothing to this day has been fixed. Secondly&#44; all the good office staff are gone&#44; only to be replaced with complete dummies who don&#39;t know what they are talking about. Josh&#44; who was a leasing agent&#44; is now the manager. WTF?? Don&#39;t know who made that call&#44; but that was the worse thing that could have happened. When i moved in&#44; i had appliances from the 80&#39;s in here. Only one eye worked on my stove....try warming bottles at 3 am and cooking dinner with only one eye. Not to mention&#44; when i turned on the burner&#44; it would spark. I complained. 8 months later&#44; i got a new stove. Then a month after that&#44; they &#34;upgraded&#34; the aparments with what they say was stainless steele applances. Well&#44; sorry sweetie&#44; but they are stainless steele plastic. But they are nice. It figures i would only get to enjoy them for 2 months before I move out. The &#34;gated&#34; community is BS. The gates have maybe worked 1 month since i moved in. If you have digital phone service through time warner&#44; you can only have one phone hooked up in the whole apartment. I was told when they came to hook up my phones&#44; that the way the lines were set up&#44; you couldn&#39;t split it to all the rooms. Parking is horrible. I live in a building where one tenant has 4 cars parked. 3 of which are broken down. The management has been in the process of &#34;towing&#34; them for months now. Meanwhile&#44; when I get home from work&#44; i have to park at another building and walk to mine with my infant son in the dark. There was a gentleman selling drugs out of his aparment on the first floor. I went to Josh and told him what was going on. I ONLY told him. He assured me it would be taken care of. 3 weeks later&#44; i went to pick up a package&#44; and some random leasing agent that was new and I had never spoken to before&#44; asked me (in front of an office full of residents and employees) if the &#34;drug problem in my building&#34; was taken care of. I was horrified. I played it off telling her she had the wrong person&#44; and trying to give her some sign to shut up&#44; but she continued saying&#44; &#34;weren&#39;t you the one who reported the gentleman selling drugs in your building.&#34; I just replied that I didn&#39;t know what she was talking about and walked out. I reported this to the management company and have yet to hear of a response. I later found out that one of the maint. guys was buddies with the guy i reported&#44; and he told him that I reported him. This guy&#44; who lived below me and used to be cordial&#44; now just stares at me. Every time he sees me come home&#44; he closes all his blinds. It has made living here scary and uncertain. Finally&#44; when i called the 800 number to renew my lease&#44; they jacked my rent up almost 100 dollars. When I told them i wouldn&#39;t pay that much&#44; they told me they would call me back with a better offer&#44; they called back with 10 bucks less than they offered before. The apartment itself is nice. They are older&#44; but if you get a unit like mine&#44; that was taken care of by the previous tenant&#44; then it&#39;s okay. However&#44; the management and parking sucks so bad&#44; it makes a great apartment&#44; suck. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> I moved into Beech Lake last year.

Folks DONT waste your time and DONT be fooled by the gated community&#39;s false sense of security!! </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="832811" data-review-id="625482"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="625482"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="536875" data-beginyear="2005" data-endyear="2006" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20061001"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2005 - 2006 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 10/01/2006</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> This was by far my worst living experience ever!

There are wasps on our porch/in our storage room rendering them completely unusable and the management&#39;s response was &#34;Well&#44; everyone has wasps...&#34; Our patio door came away from the molding and so wasps were getting into our apartment...took them a week and two reminders to fix it. Not to mention that every time the repair guy came to &#34;look&#34; at it he implied that it was somehow our fault that there were wasps IN our apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big issues: Our security chain broke (!) six months ago and they&#39;ve never replaced it. When I signed the lease two years ago&#44; we were promised a free carpet cleaning if we renewed our lease the next year. We did&#44; but at that point had pets. I asked if we could wait until the pets left (I was watching them for a friend) to get the carpet cleaned and was told that was fine. The pets left&#44; and I asked if we could get our carpet cleaned. They said they were no longer doing that program. I said they owed me a carpet cleaning&#44; program or not. We&#39;ve been trying to get the carpet cleaned for 10 months now&#44; to no avail. Every time I ask about it (at least once a month) there&#39;s some different response. Now they&#39;re saying that since we&#39;re moving out soon they&#39;ll just clean the carpet then and not charge us if it&#39;s dirty. But that&#39;s only part of the issue. The big part of the issue is that they LIED and are not upholding part of the agreement.

The gates work -maybe- two days a month.

It is expensive $749 for a 2 bedroom&#44; considering BOTH of our sound systems got robbed in this &#34;gated community&#34; When we moved in they said they&#39;d give us something for not being on the gated side..nope. Our key didn&#39;t work right&#44; and the pool did not open for months after we moved in Aug. Thin walls...you swear the music is in the next room and its four apartments over. Old rugs and hair in the bathrooms when we moved in. Our fridge smelled SO bad like mold&#44; and straight up toilet smell&#44; SO bad that my dad who visited from out of town suggested we go out to eat after i cooked him dinner. Of course the office said they&#39;d get us a new one...372 days later. They never have the right size vent filters and they NEVER answer the phone. Once i waited outside for an hour AFTER the &#34;be back from lunch&#34; time ...no one. Our A/C broke when it was 113F outside..they said they&#39;d be back on monday. Our heater tripped a few times a day for 8 months I harrassed them before they fixed it. The emergency maintenence is a joke.

The agreement on the wall that IS FRAMED quotes that any maintenence need should be attended to within 24 hours or you get money off your rent...the district manager &#34;doesn&#39;t know&#34; about this...All in all it is good but if you sign the lease expecting that they live up to the perks and rules they promise...get ready to bring out the -----. Oh and the mail man had hour long conversations outside and the mail is always arriving late. I almost forgot the pile of mud that was taking up 5 parking spaces. </div><div class="fullReviewText"><span class="text"> beech lake is a great location&#44; an awesome view and a nice apartment. It is expensive $749 for a 2 bedroom&#44; considering BOTH of our sound systems got robbed in this &#34;gated community&#34; When we moved in they said they&#39;d give us something for not being on the gated side..nope. Our key didn&#39;t work right&#44; and the pool did not open for months after we moved in Aug. Thin walls...you swear the music is in the next room and its four apartments over. Old rugs and hair in the bathrooms when we moved in. Our fridge smelled SO bad like mold&#44; and straight up toilet smell&#44; SO bad that my dad who visited from out of town suggested we go out to eat after i cooked him dinner. Of course the office said they&#39;d get us a new one...372 days later. They never have the right size vent filters and they NEVER answer the phone. Once i waited outside for an hour AFTER the &#34;be back from lunch&#34; time ...no one. Our A/C broke when it was 113F outside..they said they&#39;d be back on monday. Our heater tripped a few times a day for 8 months I harrassed them before they fixed it. The emergency maintenence is a joke.

If you are willing to put up with bad management for the price it&#39;s not too bad. Make sure you tell them 60 days in advance (in writing) that you wish to terminate your lease or you will have to rent for another month at a much higher price. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="251701" data-review-id="324436"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="324436"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="316531" data-beginyear="2004" data-endyear="2004" data-responses="0" data-score="2" data-entrydate="20050404"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="2" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2004 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 04/04/2005</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Beech Lake is in a pretty good location and the apartments there aren&#39;t so bad.

One which was capture just outside my balcony. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="165140" data-review-id="234995"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="234995"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="228305" data-beginyear="2001" data-endyear="2004" data-responses="0" data-score="5" data-entrydate="20040530"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="5" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2001 - 2004 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 05/30/2004</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I have lived at Beech Lake for three years and enjoyed it very much.

It's almost July and there is no water in the pool. Maybe we can can use the leaking water from this other guy's apartment to fill the pool. Insects are rampant. The only good thing about this is that my cat likes to play with the bugs. The equipment in the fitness room is always broken, the TV never works, and the water cooler is always empty. The maintenance guys are extremely slow, mentally and physically. The office staff are a bunch of jerks except for the new apartment manager Brian. Parking, it blows. Crime, do I even need to make mention of it, this is Durham after all. Oh yeah, I just got a letter from the office staff stating that if I want to extend my lease that I will have to pay more monthly. These people must have come straight from the Dorothea Dix insane asylum after they closed the doors for good on that looney bin. To sum it all up you would be better off spending money on a bear trap to put your nuts in. It would be less painful and cost less.</p></div></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="220490"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="199210" data-beginyear="2003" data-endyear="2004" data-responses="0" data-score="4" data-entrydate="20040310"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="4" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2003 - 2004 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Recommended Property </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 03/10/2004</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="5"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="4"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> I just moved out after 9 months.

I moved to share a house after being tired of apartment living. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="131823" data-review-id="199210"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="199210"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="195783" data-beginyear="1985" data-endyear="1987" data-responses="0" data-score="3" data-entrydate="20040228"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="3" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 1985 - 1987 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 02/28/2004</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> This is too funny.

We lived in one of the original buildings and watched the rest of Beech Lake being built. It was not quality construction. The pool was disintergrating after the 1st year. The laundry room reeked of mold and something really nasty. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The apartment itself was nicely appointed. We didn&#180;t have problems with noise from neighbors on either side.

And the apartments are large for the price. </span><a class="seeClampReview" href="#">Read less</a></div><div class="photos"></div><div class="post-response" data-review-author-id="88650" data-review-id="152163"><textarea rows="1" class="review-response-area" placeholder="Write a reply..."></textarea><button class="btn btn-primary post-response-button pull-right">POST</button><label class="pull-right post-response-label">Respond Anonymously</label><span class="pull-right post-response-checkbox fa fa-check" ></span><div class="errors"></div><div class="response-g-recaptcha"></div></div><h4 class="comments safe-color" data-comments="0"><div class="comments-bubble fa fa-comments"></div>NO COMMENTS </h4><div class="responses sub-content closed" data-comments="0"></div><div class="votes" data-complex-id="919489759927707" data-review-id="152163"><div class="vote upvote"><span>How was this review?</span><div class="button"><span class="useful">Useful</span><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote remove-upvote"><span>Thanks for voting!</span><div class="button"><div class="review-vote fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div><div class="vote report"><div class="button"><div class="review-vote" aria-hidden="true"></div><span>Report</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="section review" data-review-id="151659" data-beginyear="2001" data-endyear="2003" data-responses="0" data-score="1" data-entrydate="20030902"  style=" display: none; "><div class="holder"><div class="reviewData"><div class="summaryStatsOuter" style=""><div class="summaryStats"><div class="singleStat overall"><div id="overall" class="circular-score" data-pct="1" ><svg id="svg" width="100" height="100" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" stroke-dashoffset="282.743"></circle><circle class="score-circle" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="transparent" transform="rotate(-90 50 50)" stroke-dashoffset="0"></circle></svg></div></div><div class="reviewerInfo"><div class="reviewerType"><span class="active">Resident</span></div><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> 2001 - 2003 </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo"> Not Recommended </span><span class="grayTextReviewInfo">Reviewed 09/02/2003</span></div><div class="score-breakdown"><div class="bar-score" data-text="Noise" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Safety" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Grounds" data-pct="3"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Maintenance" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Construction" data-pct="2"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div><div class="bar-score" data-text="Office Staff" data-pct="1"><svg class="bar-svg" width="70" height="10" viewPort="0 0 100 100" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect><rect class="bar" width="62" height="7" y="0"></rect></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="reviewAndResponses"><div class="reviewText"> Quality of service is appauling.
